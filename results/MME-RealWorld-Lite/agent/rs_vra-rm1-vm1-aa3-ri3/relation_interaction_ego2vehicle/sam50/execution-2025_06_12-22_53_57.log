In general, larger vehicles like SUVs may have a greater stopping distance and require more space to maneuver, which can impact their yielding behavior in shared lanes. For example, an SUV may need to yield more than a smaller vehicle like a van, to ensure the safety of all road users. However, the specific yielding requirements may vary depending on the local traffic laws and regulations."
