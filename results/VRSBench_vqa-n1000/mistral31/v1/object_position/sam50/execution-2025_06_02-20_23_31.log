In such models, the largest harbor is typically represented by the most detailed and prominent structure. In this image, the largest structure appears to be the white building with a red logo on top, situated on an elevated area. This structure is more prominent and detailed compared to the other elements in the image, suggesting it represents the largest harbor in this model.

To help you better, could you please provide more details or clarify what you mean by the "left-most harbor"? Are you referring to a specific map or image? If you have a map or image, you can describe the landmarks or features around the harbors to help identify their positions.

1. At the top, there are multiple vehicles parked in a row.
2. Below them, there is a single dark-colored vehicle parked alone.
3. Further down, there is another vehicle parked near a structure that looks like a house or building.

So, starting from the top, you have a row of parked vehicles, followed by a single dark-colored vehicle, and then another vehicle near a building.
