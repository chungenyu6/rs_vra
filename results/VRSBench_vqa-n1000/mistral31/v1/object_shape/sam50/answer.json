        "prediction": "The image you provided shows an aerial view of a field with a distinct shape in the center. The shape appears to be a square or rectangle with rounded corners, often referred to as an \"infield\" or \"diamond\" shape, commonly found in baseball or softball fields.\n\nHowever, without additional context or specific information about what is labeled as `obj_id: 1`, it's challenging to provide a precise identification. If `obj_id: 1` refers to the entire field or the specific shape within it, then the shape is a square or rectangle with rounded corners.",
