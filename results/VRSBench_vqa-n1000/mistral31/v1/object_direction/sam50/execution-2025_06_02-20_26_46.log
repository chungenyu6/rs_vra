2025-06-02 20:28:23,399 - INFO - To determine the orientation of the tennis courts, we need to look at the layout of the courts in the image. Tennis courts are typically oriented with the baselines running either north-south or east-west.

In the image, the courts are aligned such that the longer sides (the baselines) run parallel to the top and bottom edges of the image. This suggests that the baselines are either north-south or east-west, depending on the orientation of the image.

However, without additional information about the direction of the image (e.g., which way is north), it is not possible to definitively determine the exact orientation of the courts. If you can provide more context or indicate the direction of north in the image, I can give a more precise answer.

2025-06-02 20:28:30,112 - INFO - The image shows six tennis courts arranged in two rows of three courts each. The courts in each row are oriented parallel to each other. The two rows are perpendicular to each other, forming a grid-like pattern. Specifically:

- The three courts in the top row are aligned horizontally.
- The three courts in the bottom row are also aligned horizontally but are rotated 90 degrees relative to the top row, aligning vertically.

This arrangement creates a T-shaped configuration when viewed from above.

2025-06-02 20:29:00,407 - INFO - The image shows an aerial view of an area with a runway or road crossing over water, but without additional context or geographical markers, it's challenging to determine the exact orientation of the bridge. The image does not provide clear indications of cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).

To determine if the bridge is running north-south, you would need to refer to a map or use geographical tools that can provide directional information. If you have more context or specific details about the location, I could help you better.

2025-06-02 20:29:42,223 - INFO - Prediction: To determine the orientation of the tennis courts, we need to look at the layout of the courts in the image. Tennis courts are typically oriented with the baselines running either north-south or east-west.

In the image, the courts are aligned such that the longer sides (the baselines) run parallel to the top and bottom edges of the image. This suggests that the baselines are either north-south or east-west, depending on the orientation of the image.

However, without additional information about the direction of the image (e.g., which way is north), it is not possible to definitively determine the exact orientation of the courts. If you can provide more context or indicate the direction of north in the image, I can give a more precise answer.

2025-06-02 20:29:51,612 - INFO - Prediction: The river in the image appears to run from the upper right to the lower left in relation to the urban area. This means the river is flowing in a direction that is roughly southwest.

2025-06-02 20:29:52,917 - INFO - Ground Truth: No
2025-06-02 20:29:52,917 - INFO - Prediction: The image shows an aerial view of an area with a runway or road crossing over water, but without additional context or geographical markers, it's challenging to determine the exact orientation of the bridge. The image does not provide clear indications of cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).

To determine if the bridge is running north-south, you would need to refer to a map or use geographical tools that can provide directional information. If you have more context or specific details about the location, I could help you better.

2025-06-02 20:29:54,450 - INFO - LLM (un)match reason: The predicted answer does not definitively state that the bridge is not running north-south; instead, it highlights uncertainty due to lack of directional information. The ground truth answer clearly states "No," indicating a definitive conclusion about the orientation. Therefore, they do not match semantically.

2025-06-02 20:29:55,584 - INFO - Prediction: Yes, there are roads running east-west in the image. You can see several roads that appear to traverse horizontally across the image, indicating an east-west direction. These roads intersect with other roads that run vertically, suggesting a grid-like pattern typical of many urban or suburban areas.
