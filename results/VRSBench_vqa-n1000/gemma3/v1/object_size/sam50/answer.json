This is a rough estimate, and the actual height could vary.\n*   **Platform Size:** The platform at the top appears to be relatively small, perhaps **3-5 meters (10-16 feet) wide and long**.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Perspective:** The image is taken from a distance, which can distort the perceived size of objects.\n*   **Lack of Reference:** Without a known object of known size in the image, it's difficult to make a more accurate estimate.\n\n**To get a more precise measurement, we would need:**\n\n*   **More detailed images:** Closer-up shots of the structure.\n*   **Information about the location:** Knowing the location could help find information about the structure's known dimensions.\n*   **Comparison with known objects:** If there were a boat or other object of known size nearby, it could be used as a reference.",
