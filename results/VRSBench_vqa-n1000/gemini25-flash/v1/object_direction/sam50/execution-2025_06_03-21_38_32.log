2025-06-03 21:38:48,844 - INFO - The ships are **not placed horizontally** (parallel to the top/bottom edges of the image).

They are aligned along a pier that runs diagonally from the top-right to the bottom-left. Their bows (front ends) are generally pointing towards the **top-right** corner of the image. So, they are **oriented towards the top** (specifically, the top-right) rather than the bottom.
