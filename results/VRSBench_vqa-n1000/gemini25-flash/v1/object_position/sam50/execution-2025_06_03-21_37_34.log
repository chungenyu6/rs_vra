2025-06-03 21:37:42,897 - INFO - The road in the image runs diagonally.

More specifically, it extends from the **top-right** portion of the image down towards the **bottom-left**.

Assuming a standard map orientation where North is at the top, this would mean the road is oriented in a **Northeast-Southwest** direction.
