*   **Auxiliary Building:** A smaller building next to the main house, likely a garage, guesthouse, or workshop.
*   **Driveway/Paved Area:** A paved area with a white vehicle parked on it.
*   **Landscaped Grounds:** Extensive green areas, including lawns and what appears to be decorative planting beds.
*   **Waterfront Access:** A prominent dock or pier extends from the property into a body of water at the bottom right, indicating it's a waterfront property.
*   **Other Structures:** A circular paved area (possibly a helipad or large patio) and another smaller white structure at the top (perhaps a gazebo or deck).

Overall, it depicts a spacious, well-maintained property, likely in a suburban or semi-rural setting, with direct access to water.
