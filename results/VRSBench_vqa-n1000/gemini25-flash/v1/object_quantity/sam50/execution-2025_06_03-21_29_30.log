2025-06-03 21:35:29,774 - INFO - Based on the image, there are **0** harbors visible in the traditional sense (a large, sheltered area for numerous ships, often with commercial or public facilities).

What is visible are two distinct **docking structures** or piers for boats:
1.  On the left side, a smaller dock with one white boat.
2.  On the right side, a larger pier-like structure with multiple slips, where at least two boats (one blue, one orange/red) are visible.

These are more accurately described as private docks or a very small private marina, rather than a harbor.

2025-06-03 21:35:42,004 - INFO - Let's count the watercraft visible in the image:

1.  **At the left dock:**
    *   One white pontoon-style boat.
    *   Two blue personal watercraft (like jet skis or small inflatables) closer to the shore.
2.  **At the right dock:**
    *   One grey boat.
    *   One smaller, lighter-colored boat next to the grey one.

The large white and blue circular structure with the "T" shape in the upper left is a floating recreational platform, not a ship or boat for transport, so it is not counted.

Counting these, there are **5** ships/boats present in the image.

What is visible are individual **docks or piers** (the T-shaped structure and the L-shaped structure on the left) and a few boats. These are typically associated with private residences or small recreational use, not a full-fledged harbor.

What is visible are two private or small community **docks/piers** extending into the water, with boats moored to them. A harbor typically implies a larger, more protected area for numerous vessels, often with extensive infrastructure, which is not present here.

2025-06-03 21:37:20,282 - INFO - Based on the image, I can identify three structures that serve as small harbors or docks for boats:

1.  **On the left:** A long, straight dock with a personal watercraft (like a jet ski) at its end.
2.  **On the right:** A larger, L-shaped dock structure with what appears to be a boat lift or another boat moored.
3.  **In the middle, between the two main docks:** A smaller, rectangular dock or platform extending into the water.

Therefore, there are **3** small harbors visible.
