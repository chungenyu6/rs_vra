Let's assume an average width of approximately **5 feet (1.5 meters)** for the pier.\n\n2.  **Estimate the boat's length relative to the pier's width:** Visually, the boat's length appears to be about 4 to 5 times the width of the pier. Let's estimate it as approximately **4.5 times** the pier's width.\n\n3.  **Calculate the boat's length:**\n    *   Using the estimated pier width of 5 feet: 4.5 * 5 feet = **22.5 feet**\n    *   Using the estimated pier width of 1.5 meters: 4.5 * 1.5 meters = **6.75 meters**\n\nTherefore, the ship (boat) is approximately **22 to 23 feet (6.7 to 7 meters) long**.",

The main walkway of the pier appears to be segmented into several sections (approximately 8-9 visible segments along the main shaft).\n2.  **Submerged/Partially Submerged Structures (Left):** To the left of the main pier, there are:\n    *   Two distinct, roughly rectangular or square-shaped objects.\n    *   A longer, irregular, and fragmented structure that appears to be submerged or partially submerged, possibly the remains of an older or broken pier/dock.\n\nWithout a scale, I can only describe its appearance and relative proportions, not its absolute dimensions.",
