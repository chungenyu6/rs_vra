The revised answer states three individuals are present. The user now expects a simple yes or no.\n\nThe answer should be \"Yes\" since there are three people. The FinalAnswer function needs to confirm presence without extra details. The references and questions were part of the prior steps, but the current query just needs a direct response. So, the final answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
