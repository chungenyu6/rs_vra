Then the assistant asked the vision model, which responded with \"0\", probably meaning no phone detected. The revised answer then confirmed that using the vision model's input.\n\nNow, the user is prompting again with the system reminder to answer based on the last revision. The last revision's final answer, citing reference [3], states the vision model found no cell phone. So the answer should be \"No\" through the FinalAnswer function.\n\nI need to make sure to use the FinalAnswer format and keep it concise.
