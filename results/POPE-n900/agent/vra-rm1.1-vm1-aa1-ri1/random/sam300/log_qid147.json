The revised answer includes that detail. Now, I need to provide the final answer using the FinalAnswer function. Let me check the last revision. The revised answer states there are two tennis balls, located near the center and right side. So the final answer should confirm the presence of the sports balls (tennis balls) based on the confirmed information. Just need to phrase it concisely, making sure to include the confirmation from the vision model. \n\nYes, there are two tennis balls on the court, located near the center and toward the right side, as confirmed by the vision model.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nYes, there are two tennis balls on the court, located near the center and toward the right side, as confirmed by the vision model.\n</FinalAnswer>"
