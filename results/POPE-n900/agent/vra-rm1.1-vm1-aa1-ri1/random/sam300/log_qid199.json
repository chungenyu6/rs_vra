So I need to correct that. The user wants the final answer using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nLooking at the last revision, it says two women are present, citing reference [2]. The references clarify that the initial description had one woman, but the vision model confirmed two. The user's latest query is just a prompt to finalize, so the answer should be \"Yes\" since there are two people. The numerical citations are already handled in the previous step. I should just confirm the presence, which is definitely there. So the final answer is Yes.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
