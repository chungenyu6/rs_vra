The previous steps concluded that there are no birds in the image, supported by references from the vision model's responses.\n\nThe user's question was \"Is there a bird in the image?\" The answer is no. The last revision confirmed this with references. I need to present this as a straightforward yes or no. Since the information from the vision model explicitly states no birds are present, the answer is definitely \"No.\" \n\nI should make sure not to include any extra details or explanations, just the direct answer as per the instructions. Use the FinalAnswer function with \"No\" as the content. That's it.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
