The user first asked that, and the assistant said yes, mentioning a few chairs. Then the vision model clarified there are exactly two chairs: one occupied, one empty. The revised answer confirmed two chairs. Now the user is asking again, but maybe they want a simple yes/no.\n\nThe current question is exactly the same as the initial one. The answer should be yes because the vision model clearly stated there are two chairs. So I need to respond with \"Yes\" using the FinalAnswer function. No need for extra details since the user just wants a direct answer this time.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
