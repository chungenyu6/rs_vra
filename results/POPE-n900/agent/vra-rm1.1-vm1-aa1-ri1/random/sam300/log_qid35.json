But then the vision model pointed out there are two women carrying handbags. So the correct answer should be yes. The user wants a direct 'Yes' or 'No' now. The latest info from the vision model confirms handbags are present. I need to make sure I don't second-guess that. Just answer based on the last revision which includes the vision model's update. So the answer is definitely Yes.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
