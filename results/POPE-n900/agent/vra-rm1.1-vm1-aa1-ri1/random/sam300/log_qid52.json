The initial answer described the table items but didn't mention a racket. Then, when asked about objects outside the table, the vision model confirmed no racket was present. The revised answer clearly states there's no tennis racket and lists the items seen. Since all sources agree there's no racket, the answer should be a straightforward \"No\".\n\nNeed to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Make sure to keep it concise and accurate. No extra details are needed since the user just wants a yes or no. Yep, the information from both tool responses confirms the absence of a tennis racket. So the final answer is \"No\".\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
