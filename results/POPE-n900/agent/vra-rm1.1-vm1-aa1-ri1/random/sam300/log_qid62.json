Let me check the conversation history again.\n\nThe user initially asked if there's a knife in the image. The first answer said no, based on the provided image description. Then there was a follow-up question to the vision model, which confirmed no knives or tools. The revised answer combined both sources, stating no knife is present and listing the objects seen. \n\nNow, the user's latest input is just \"Yes\" and \"No\" instructions, but the actual query is to use the FinalAnswer function. The last revision already concluded there's no knife. The system reminder says to use FinalAnswer directly. \n\nI need to make sure the final answer is concise, uses the function, and is based on the previous steps. The correct response should be \"FinalAnswer: No\" since all sources confirm no knife is present.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: No"
