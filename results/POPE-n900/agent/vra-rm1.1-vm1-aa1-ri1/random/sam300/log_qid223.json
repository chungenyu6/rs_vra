The first response mentioned a snowboard in the bottom-left corner, but my analysis thought that might be incorrect because the main subject was a skier. However, when the vision model checked again, it confirmed a snowboard in the foreground. So now, with the updated information from the vision model, the correct answer should be \"Yes\" since the model's latest input confirms the snowboard's presence. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nYes\n</FinalAnswer>"
