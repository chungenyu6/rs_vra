The assistant first answered yes, then the vision model confirmed it's in a bowl on the table. Now the user is prompting to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nI need to make sure the final answer is concise and confirms the presence. The previous responses already established that broccoli is present, so the answer should be a straightforward \"Yes\" using the specified function. No need for extra details since the question is just about existence.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
