Then, after the vision model provided more info about 12 people and their activities, the answer was revised to include those specifics. Now, the user is prompting again with an empty query, but the system reminder says to answer based on the last revision.\n\nLooking at the history, the latest answer mentions 12 people, their activities, and a bus. The user's current input is just \"Yes\" followed by the system prompt. Wait, no, the user's latest message is empty, but the system is reminding to use the FinalAnswer function. Maybe the user is asking again, but perhaps the actual question is to confirm if there's a person, which was already answered. Alternatively, maybe the user is following up after the revised answer. \n\nWait, the user's latest message is empty, but the system prompt says to answer based on the last revision. The last question from the user before the empty message was \"Is there a person in the image?\" which was answered. But the user might be expecting an updated answer with the new info. The revised answer already states there are 12 people, so the answer is still yes. The system wants the final answer in the function. So the correct response here is to confirm \"Yes\" using the FinalAnswer syntax, referencing the latest data.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
