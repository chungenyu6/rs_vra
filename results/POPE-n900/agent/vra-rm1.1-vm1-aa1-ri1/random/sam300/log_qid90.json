Then there was a follow-up check using the vision model again, which also confirmed no large animals like elephants. The revised answer combined both sources, citing [1] and [2]. Now, the user is prompting again with the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nI need to make sure the answer is concise and uses the FinalAnswer format. The key points are that there's no elephant, the image has buses, people, and a bench. The references are already included in the previous steps, so the final answer should just state \"No\" clearly. Wait, the user's last input was the system reminder, so the previous message from the assistant had the revised answer. The user might want the final answer now without extra details. The correct response here is simply \"No\" wrapped in the FinalAnswer function. Let me check again. The question is \"Is there an elephant in the image?\" and all evidence points to no, so yes, \"No\" is correct.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer[No]"
