Then, after some back-and-forth and a vision model input, the revised answer specified there are two people: one playing and one watching. The latest response from the vision model confirmed that there are 2 people. \n\nThe user's current query is just \"Yes\" in the input field. Wait, maybe I need to check again. The user might be asking if there's a person, and based on the latest info, the answer is definitely yes. The final answer should use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. So, the answer is yes, with the details from the revised answer mentioning the two people. I need to make sure to include the references and keep it concise.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, there are **2 people** in the image: a woman actively playing tennis (holding a racket and serving) and a spectator watching [1].  \n\nReferences:  \n[1] Vision model response: \"2 people... woman playing tennis and another person watching.\""
