Then, after getting more info that the truck is parked on the roadside, the revised answer incorporated that detail. Now, the user is prompting again with a system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function. \n\nI need to make sure the final answer is concise and includes all necessary info from the revisions. The last revision's answer was \"Yes, a parked truck is present on the roadside [1][2].\" But the system wants the FinalAnswer function here. Also, check if citations are needed. Since the user's last message is a reminder to use FinalAnswer, maybe the citations can be omitted for brevity, as the answer is already confirmed through the revisions.\n\nThe key points are: truck exists, it's parked, and on the roadside. So the final answer should be a simple \"Yes\" with the details included. Using the FinalAnswer format as specified.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, there is a parked truck visible on the roadside in the image."
