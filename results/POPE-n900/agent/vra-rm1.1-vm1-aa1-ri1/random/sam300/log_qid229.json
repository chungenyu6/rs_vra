Then, after the vision model's follow-up, the revised answer included their smiles and the brick building. Now, the user is prompting again with the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nLooking at the latest information: the vision model mentioned the boys are smiling and the building has no distinctive features. The current answer correctly states there are people. Since all updates are already incorporated, the final answer should confirm \"Yes\" concisely, referencing the existing sources. No new data provided, so just need to present the confirmed answer.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>  \nYes, the image includes multiple people: at least thirteen boys in school uniforms smiling outdoors near a brick building.
