Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nThe initial description mentioned that some riders wear cowboy hats, but it didn't specify the leader's attire. The follow-up from the vision model stated there are six people: five men riding and one man leading, but again, no details on clothing differences. \n\nSince there's no explicit information about the leader's clothing being distinct, I should answer based on available data. The answer should be \"No\" because the provided details don't mention the leader wearing anything different from the riders. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer,No"
