Then the vision model checked and confirmed there's no spoon. The revised answer now states there's no spoon, citing the vision model. The user's current query is just \"FinalAnswer\", so I need to present the final response using the specified function. The answer should be \"No\" based on the references provided. Make sure to use the function call as instructed.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer[No]"
