The initial answer said no, and after checking again with a follow-up question about sports equipment, it was confirmed that there are no sports items like rackets or balls. The latest query from the assistant asks about reflective surfaces that might obscure object detection, but the user hasn't responded further. \n\nWait, actually, looking back, the user's last message was just the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function. The assistant's last question about reflective surfaces was part of their own thinking, but since the user hasn't provided new info, the answer should stick to the existing evidence.\n\nThe key points are: the image has people, wine glasses, a cell phone, but no sports equipment. The tennis racket isn't mentioned in any of the provided descriptions. So the final answer should clearly state that there's no tennis racket, citing the references. Need to make sure it's concise and uses the FinalAnswer format as instructed.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(No, there is no tennis racket in the image. The scene includes people socializing with wine glasses and a cell phone, but no sports equipment is visible [1][2].)"
