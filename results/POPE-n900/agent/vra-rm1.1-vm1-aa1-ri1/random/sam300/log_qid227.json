The initial answer confirmed skis on the main skier and mentioned another pair further away. The revised answer incorporated the vision model's clarification that the main skier's skis are attached to their feet and there's another pair on the slope.\n\nNow, the user is prompting for a final answer using the FinalAnswer function. The last interaction shows the system reminder to use the function. The user hasn't asked a new question but is likely expecting the final response based on revisions. The latest information from the vision model (reference [2]) confirms two pairs of skis. \n\nSo, the final answer should succinctly state that yes, there are skis: the main skier's and another pair, citing the reference. Need to ensure it's formatted correctly with the function and references.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes, the image includes skis. The main skier has them attached to their feet [2], and another pair is visible further down the slope [2].)"
