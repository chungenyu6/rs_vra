Now the user is prompting again with the FinalAnswer function. I need to make sure the answer is concise and uses the FinalAnswer format. The previous answers already stated there's no snowboard, so the final answer should just be \"No\" enclosed in the function. No need for extra details since the user wants a direct response.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer[No]"
