Then, the vision model checked again and confirmed there are none. The revised answer uses citation [1], which I think refers to the vision model's response. So, putting it all together, the final answer should stick with \"No\" using the provided evidence. Need to make sure the FinalAnswer function is called correctly with the revised statement.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo potted plants are present in the image [1]. The scene includes people, dining tables with tableware, and cakes, but no plants are visible in the background or on tables.\n</FinalAnswer>"
