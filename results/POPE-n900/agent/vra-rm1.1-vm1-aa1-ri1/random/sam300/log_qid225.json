Let me check the latest information.\n\nIn the initial description, there's a skier on top and another person further back. The vision model clarified that one is skiing actively, and the other is on a snowboard. The revised answer says two people: one skiing downhill and another on a snowboard. The references point to the vision model's response.\n\nThe user's final question via the system prompt is to answer with the FinalAnswer function. Since the answer already confirms two people, I need to make sure the response is concise and uses the required format.\n\nThe answer should be \"Yes\" since there are people. The previous answers established that, so the final answer should just confirm with \"Yes\" as per the user's initial request.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
