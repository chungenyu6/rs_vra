Let me look at the latest information.\n\nIn the previous messages, the assistant mentioned two suitcases: a large black one and a smaller brown one. The vision model's responses [1] and [2] confirm their presence. Since both are suitcases, the answer is definitely yes. The user just wants a simple \"Yes\" this time, so I should use the FinalAnswer function without extra details. No need for references here since the answer is straightforward based on the provided data.\n\nFinal check: The question is yes/no, and the sources confirm two suitcases. Answer is \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
