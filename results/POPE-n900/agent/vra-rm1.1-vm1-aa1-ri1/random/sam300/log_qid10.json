Then, to be thorough, I asked a follow-up question through the vision model to check for any food items or other circular objects besides the frisbees. The vision model's answer confirmed there are none. So, combining both responses, there's definitely no cake or other food items. The answer should remain no.\n\nNeed to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. The final answer is \"No\" because all checks confirm no cake is present. Make sure to format it correctly with the JSON structure specified.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"FinalAnswer\", \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"No\"}}"
