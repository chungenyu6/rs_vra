The follow-up confirmed it's parked on a street but didn't mention color. The last revision's answer still states it's a white truck. So the color is clearly stated as white. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. The answer should be straightforward.\n\nFinal answer should be \"white\" based on the references provided. Make sure to format it correctly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer> The truck's body is white. </FinalAnswer>"
