Then, after a critique, a follow-up question was asked to the vision model, which confirmed no clocks. The revised answer included both sources. Now the user is prompting to use the FinalAnswer function. \n\nThe latest info from the vision model is clear: \"No clocks or timekeeping devices visible.\" So the answer should be \"No\" using the FinalAnswer format. Need to make sure it's concise and directly answers with 'No' as per the user's instruction.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
