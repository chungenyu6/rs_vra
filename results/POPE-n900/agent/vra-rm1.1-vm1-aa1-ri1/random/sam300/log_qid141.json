Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nLooking back at the previous interactions, the initial description mentioned a skateboarder and other people, but there was no color information. The follow-up answers from the vision model focused on the observers' attention but didn't mention colors either. Since the user's current question is about colors, which hasn't been addressed yet, the vision model needs to provide that specific detail. \n\nThe user wants the answer to use the FinalAnswer function, so I should structure it properly. Since the color info isn't in the existing data, I need to prompt the vision model to retrieve it. The assistant should ask the vision model for the skateboarder's clothing color and the nearest vehicle's color. That way, the next response can include the necessary details once available.\n</think>\n\nThe skateboarder's clothing and the nearest vehicle's color were not explicitly described in the provided information. I will ask the vision model for this detail.  \n\n**Question for Vision Model:** What are the specific colors of the skateboarder\u2019s clothing and the nearest vehicle in the image?"
