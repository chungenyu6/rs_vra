Then, when I checked further with the vision model, it confirmed there are no large animals, just the river scene. The revised answer uses references to support that there's no elephant. So, the final answer should stick to that. I need to use the FinalAnswer function and make sure it's concise. Just a straightforward \"No\" with the given reasons.\n\nWait, the revised answer already says \"No elephant is present. The image shows a river with boats and people, and no large animals [1,2,3].\" So I should present that as the final answer, but maybe in a more user-friendly way without the references. The user just wants a yes or no, but since they allowed a direct answer, maybe rephrase it simply. But the system reminder says to use the FinalAnswer function. Let me check the example again. The example uses the function call format. So I need to structure it properly. The user's last message shows the system reminder, so the answer must be in the FinalAnswer JSON.\n\nAlright, putting it all together: the final answer is no, so the JSON should reflect that. The revised answer's content is correct. I'll format it as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\n{\n  \"answer\": \"No\",\n  \"explanation\": \"The image depicts a peaceful riverside scene with boats, people, and a building in the background. No elephants or large animals are present, as confirmed by the vision model analysis.\"\n}\n</FinalAnswer>"
