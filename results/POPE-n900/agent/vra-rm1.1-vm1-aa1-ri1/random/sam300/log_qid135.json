The first answer was \"No\" with references. Then the user wanted a revision using new visual info. The vision model checked again and confirmed no benches. The revised answer cited both sources. Now the user's latest query is just a prompt to finalize, using the FinalAnswer function. \n\nThe last revision already states no bench, so the final answer should be \"No\" encapsulated properly. Need to make sure it's concise and uses the required function. Also, check if any references are needed, but the user's reminder says to directly answer. So just \"No\" inside FinalAnswer.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
