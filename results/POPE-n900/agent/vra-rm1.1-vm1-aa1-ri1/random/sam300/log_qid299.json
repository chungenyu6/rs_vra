Then the vision model clarified that there is a toilet next to the sink and shower. Now the user is prompting me to use the FinalAnswer function with the revised info.\n\nI need to make sure the answer is straightforward. The final answer should be \"Yes\" since the vision model confirmed the toilet's presence. The references and citations were part of the previous steps, but the user now wants just the direct answer wrapped in the FinalAnswer function. So I'll just respond with \"Yes\" using the specified format.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nYes\n</FinalAnswer>"
