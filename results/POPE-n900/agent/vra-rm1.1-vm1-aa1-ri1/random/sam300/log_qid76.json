Then when I checked again by asking about sports equipment, the vision model said there's none. So combining both sources, the answer is definitely no. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Just need to state it clearly without extra details now.\n\nFinal answer should be \"No\" based on the references provided. Make sure to use the function properly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer,No"
