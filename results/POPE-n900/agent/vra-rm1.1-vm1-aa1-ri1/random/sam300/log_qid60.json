Then, the user's follow-up question, generated by the assistant, asked about large animals or unusual objects in the background, to which the vision model also replied no.\n\nNow, the user is prompting again with the \"FinalAnswer\" function. Since all previous steps confirmed there's no elephant and no large animals, the final answer should be a straightforward \"No\" encapsulated in the specified format. I need to make sure to use the FinalAnswer JSON structure as instructed.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer({\"answer\": \"No\"})"
