Let me check the conversation history.\n\nInitially, the assistant said yes, the spoon is there, based on the description. The user then provided a revised answer with references from the vision model's confirmation. The latest query is just \"Yes\" with a system prompt to use the FinalAnswer function. \n\nWait, the user's last input was just \"Yes\" followed by the system reminder. But looking back, the user might have been confirming something. However, the actual question was already answered. The task now is to provide the final answer using the specified function. The previous answer already confirmed the spoon's presence with references. Since there's no new question, just the system prompt, I should just present the final answer as \"Yes\" with the references included. \n\nMake sure to format it correctly with the FinalAnswer function and include the references as per the last revision. The answer should be concise and match the required structure.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes. The spoon is clearly visible [1], placed next to a cereal bowl [2].</FinalAnswer>"
