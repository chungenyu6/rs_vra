The user asked, \"Is there a car in the image?\" \n\nLooking at the revised answer, it says cars are present, some fully visible, others partially obscured. The references back up that there are indeed cars. The follow-up question about colors was asked, but the user's main question was just whether there's a car. \n\nThe answer clearly states \"Cars are present,\" so the answer is yes. The system prompt says to use the FinalAnswer function with a direct yes or no. Even though the revised answer has more details, the core answer is affirmative. Need to make sure to follow the instruction to use FinalAnswer and keep it simple. \n\nFinal answer should just be \"Yes\" since the presence is confirmed.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
