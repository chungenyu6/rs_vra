The latest information from the vision model states there are 10 cars. The references confirm the presence of cars both from the initial description and the count provided. Since the answer clearly states there are ten cars, the answer to the original question is definitely yes. I need to use the FinalAnswer function to respond succinctly. Just need to make sure to encapsulate it correctly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
