The initial answer mentioned a girl and other people, but the vision model's response [1] corrected that to only one person, the girl, with no others. So the correct answer should confirm the girl's presence and clarify there are no other people. The user wants a direct \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer using the FinalAnswer function. Since the image does have the girl, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\nI need to make sure I'm using the latest information from the vision model, which states there's exactly one person. The previous answer had an error about other people, but the revised answer based on [1] corrects that. So the final answer should be \"Yes\" because the girl is present. No need for extra details since the user asked for a direct yes/no. Just confirm the presence of at least one person.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
