But the vision model's updated response only confirmed one background person whose details are unclear.\n\nThe user then asked for the background person's position (left or right). The vision model's response shows the background person is on the left. So the answer should specify that. Need to use the FinalAnswer format and reference [2] since that's where the position was mentioned. Keep it concise.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, the background person is located on the left side of the image [2]."
