So I checked again with the vision model, which confirmed the bowl is empty. Now, the revised answer states the bowl is present and empty, citing the references.\n\nThe user's latest query is just \"Is there a bowl in the image?\" again. Since the final revised answer already confirms the bowl exists and is empty, I need to respond directly using the FinalAnswer function. The answer should be \"Yes\" because the bowl is present. The empty part is additional info, but the core question is existence, which is confirmed. So the final answer is \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
