But then the vision model provided new info stating there's a person holding an umbrella. So the revised answer should confirm the umbrella's presence.\n\nThe user then asked for a final answer, emphasizing to use the FinalAnswer function. The previous steps showed the correction from the vision model. The correct response now is \"Yes\" because the updated information confirms the umbrella exists in the image. Need to make sure to follow the instructions precisely and only output \"Yes\" without extra text.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
