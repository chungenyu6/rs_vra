Then the user's follow-up using the vision model confirmed no indoor appliances. The revised answer said no oven is present, citing reference [1]. Now the user is prompting again with an empty message and a reminder to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nHmm, the user probably wants a concise yes or no answer. The previous steps concluded there's no oven. The vision model response also supports that. So the final answer should be \"No\" without any extra details, just as per the user's initial instruction. Need to make sure to use the FinalAnswer function properly here.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
