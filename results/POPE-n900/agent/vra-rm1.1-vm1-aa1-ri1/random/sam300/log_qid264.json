Then I checked with the vision model, which confirmed there aren't any. Now, the revised answer using the ReviseAnswer function also states there's no wine glass, referencing both the vision model and the original description. The system prompt tells me to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision. So I need to present the final answer as \"No\" using the specified format.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(No)"
