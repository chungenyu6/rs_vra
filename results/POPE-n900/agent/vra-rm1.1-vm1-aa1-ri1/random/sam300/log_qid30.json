Then, after a critique, the answer was revised to check outside the display case as well. The vision model confirmed there are no animals or birds outside. Now, the user is asking again, and I need to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nLooking at the last revision, the answer clearly states no birds are present anywhere. The references back that up. So the final answer should be a straightforward \"No\" encapsulated in the function. I need to make sure to use the exact syntax specified: FinalAnswer[No]. No extra text, just the function with the answer.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer[No]"
