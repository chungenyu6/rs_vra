Then the user provided more info from a vision model that mentioned the buses are yellow and green, parked at a terminal with no other vehicles. The revised answer included that, citing references. Now the user is prompting with an empty message but the system reminder says to use the FinalAnswer function. \n\nThe latest version of the answer clearly states there are two buses (yellow and green) present. The question is straightforward: \"Is there a bus in the image?\" The answer is yes. The references confirm their presence. I need to use the FinalAnswer function with a simple \"Yes\" since the question is just checking for existence, not details like color or count. The user might want a concise response now.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
