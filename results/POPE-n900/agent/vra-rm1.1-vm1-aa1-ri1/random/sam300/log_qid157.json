The previous conversation established that there is one, and the latest info from the vision model says it's yellow and visible. The revised answer already confirms the presence, color, and context. The user's current query is just a prompt to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nThe user's latest input is an empty message with a reminder to use the FinalAnswer function. Since the last answer was already provided and the system is prompting to finalize, I need to present the final answer based on the last revision. The answer should be \"Yes\" since the glove is confirmed. The details like color and position were addressed in the revisions, but the core question is just whether it exists. So the final answer is \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
