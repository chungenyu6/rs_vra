The vision model confirmed no fruits are present. The revised answer uses that info and cites the reference. Now, the user wants the final answer via the FinalAnswer function. Since all steps confirm no orange and no fruits, the answer is straightforward.\n\nFinal answer should be \"No\" because the revised answer and references clearly state no fruits are present. No need for extra details here. Just a direct \"No\" as per the user's instruction.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
