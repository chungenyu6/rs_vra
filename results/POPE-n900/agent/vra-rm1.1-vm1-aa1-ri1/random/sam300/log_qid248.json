The initial scene description mentions a busy city street with vehicles and pedestrians, no mention of ovens. The vision model's follow-up response explicitly states there are no indoor appliances or kitchen items. So combining both sources, the answer is definitely no. Need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(No)"
