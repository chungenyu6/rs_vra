Let me check the previous information provided.\n\nThe initial image description mentions a \"dining table\" with a tray of food, but it doesn't specify the table's color or material. The follow-up questions focused on whether there was a suitcase and other objects, but the vision model's responses didn't mention the table's details beyond it being a dining table. \n\nSince there's no explicit information about the table's color or material in the provided descriptions, I can't answer that. The user might need more details, so I should state that the information isn't available in the given data. But wait, the user instructed to use the FinalAnswer function. Since the question is about the table's attributes not mentioned, the answer should reflect that it's unspecified.\n\nHmm, need to make sure I'm following the instructions correctly. The user wants a direct answer using the FinalAnswer function. Since the data doesn't include color or material, the answer has to be that it's not provided. Alright, proceed with that.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The color and material of the table surface are not specified in the provided image description."
