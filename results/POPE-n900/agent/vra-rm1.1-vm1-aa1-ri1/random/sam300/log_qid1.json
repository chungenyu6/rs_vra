Now, the user's latest query is a follow-up asking for the colors of the umbrellas. \n\nLooking back, the initial tool response mentioned people holding umbrellas but didn't specify colors. The vision model's answer only confirmed the umbrellas are open, not their hues. Since no color information was provided in the references [1] or [2], I can't answer that. \n\nThe user's question now is about umbrella colors, which isn't addressed in the given data. I need to state that the color isn't specified in the available information. The instructions say to use the FinalAnswer function, so I should format the response accordingly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The color of the umbrellas is not specified in the available information."
