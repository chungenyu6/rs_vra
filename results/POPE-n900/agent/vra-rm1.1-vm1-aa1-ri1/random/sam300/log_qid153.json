The user asked, \"Is there a person in the image?\" based on the provided descriptions.\n\nFirst, in the initial response, I answered \"Yes\" and cited references [1] and [2]. The references point to the mentions of pedestrians in the scene descriptions. The first reference comes from the original image description stating there are pedestrians on the sidewalk. The second reference is from the follow-up where the vision model specified their positions near the crosswalk and traffic lights.\n\nNow, the user's latest query is just a blank line, but the system reminder says to use the FinalAnswer function. Since the question was already answered and the last revision confirmed the presence of people with references, the final answer should restate that clearly. The key is to confirm the presence of a person based on the given info without extra details. The answer should be straightforward: \"Yes\" because the descriptions explicitly mention pedestrians.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
