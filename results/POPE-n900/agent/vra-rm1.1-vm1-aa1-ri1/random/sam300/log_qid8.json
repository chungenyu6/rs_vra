The latest response included references and a question to the vision model. Now, the user is prompting again with the \"FinalAnswer\" function.\n\nI need to make sure I use the FinalAnswer format. The user's last message was a system reminder to directly answer using the FinalAnswer function. The previous interaction shows that the answer is \"No,\" based on the provided descriptions and the vision model's confirmation. \n\nSo, I should structure the response as a JSON object with \"answer\" set to \"No\" and ensure it's correctly formatted. No new information has been introduced since the last update, so the answer remains consistent. I must avoid adding extra text outside the JSON to comply with the instructions.\n</think>\n\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}"
