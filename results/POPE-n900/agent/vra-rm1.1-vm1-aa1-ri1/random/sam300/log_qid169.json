Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nIn the initial image description, the assistant mentioned a knife resting on the counter but didn't specify the color. The follow-up tool call response stated the woman is actively chopping fruits with the knife but still no color. \n\nSince there's no mention of the knife's color in any provided references ([1] and [2]), I can't confirm the color. The user expects a direct answer using the FinalAnswer function, so I should state that the color isn't specified in the available information. Need to keep it concise and cite the references properly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nThe color of the knife is not specified in the provided visual information [1][2].\n</FinalAnswer>"
