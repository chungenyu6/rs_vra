Then the user's next question was to ask about the cars' colors and positions. The vision model responded that the cars are blurry, so details like color or exact positions can't be seen.\n\nNow, the task is to revise the answer based on this new information. The previous revision mentioned that cars are present but their details are obscured due to blurriness, citing references 1 and 2. The user now wants the final answer using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nI need to make sure the answer is concise and includes the necessary information from the revisions. The key points are: cars exist in the image, but their specifics (color, exact positions) are unclear because they're blurry. The references should point to where these details were mentioned. \n\nLet me check the references again. The first reference (1) comes from the initial description mentioning the presence of cars. The second reference (2) is from the vision model's response about the blurriness. So the final answer should clearly state both points and correctly reference the sources. \n\nI think that's all. Just need to format it properly with the FinalAnswer function.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nCars are present in the image [1], but their details (e.g., color or exact positions) are obscured due to blurriness [2].\n</FinalAnswer>"
