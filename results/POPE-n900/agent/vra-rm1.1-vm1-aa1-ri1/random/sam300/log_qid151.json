Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nThe initial scene description mentions several cars driving down the street and parked vehicles, but it doesn't explicitly say if any are stopped at the traffic lights. The vision model previously confirmed the traffic lights are yellow but didn't mention vehicles stopping. Since there's no specific data about vehicles stopping at the yellow lights in the provided references [1] or [2], I should answer based on available info. The description says cars are driving, but parked cars are along the side. Without explicit mention of stopping at the lights, the answer would be no. But wait, maybe the traffic lights being yellow implies some cars are stopping? The original scene includes a stop sign near the center, but that's separate. Since the user's last question is about vehicles stopped at the yellow lights, and the references don't include that detail, I have to say no. The FinalAnswer should be \"No\" using the references provided.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: No. The scene description mentions cars driving and parked vehicles but does not specify any vehicles stopped at the yellow traffic lights [1][2]."
