Looking back at the conversation history, the vision model confirmed there's a baseball clearly visible near the batter. The revised answer already states that the baseball is present and in mid-air. The user's latest query is a reminder to use the FinalAnswer function directly.\n\nI need to make sure the answer is concise and uses the FinalAnswer format. The key points are the presence of the baseball and its position. Since the vision model's response [2] confirms it's unobstructed and near the batter, I can confidently say \"Yes\" with the specifics. Also, references [1] and [2] should be included as per the previous instructions. Let me structure this properly without any extra text.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes, a baseball (sports ball) is present in the image [1], clearly visible in mid-air near the batter's swing zone with no obstructions [2].</FinalAnswer>"
