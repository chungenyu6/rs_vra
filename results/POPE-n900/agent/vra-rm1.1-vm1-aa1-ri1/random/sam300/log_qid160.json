Let me look at the latest information.\n\nThe initial answer said no TV, but then the user provided a follow-up from the vision tool that mentioned a screen in the background, possibly a scoreboard. The revised answer clarified that there's a screen (scoreboard) but not a TV. \n\nThe user's current query is just the word \"TV\" again, so I need to confirm based on the latest data. The references now include the vision tool's input which distinguishes the screen as a scoreboard, not a TV. So the answer remains \"No\" because a scoreboard isn't a TV. I should use the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo, there is no TV in the image. A scoreboard or information display is present instead [1][2].\n</FinalAnswer>"
