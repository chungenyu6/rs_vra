Then the user's assistant checked with a vision model, which confirmed no octagonal red objects. The revised answer used references to the context and the vision check.\n\nNow, the user wants the final answer using the FinalAnswer function. The last revision's revised answer says \"No stop sign is present...\" so I should just present that as the final answer. Make sure to format it correctly without any markdown. Just the function call with the answer string.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo stop sign is present. The image shows a bowl of vegetables on a wooden table, with no octagonal red objects detected.\n</FinalAnswer>"
