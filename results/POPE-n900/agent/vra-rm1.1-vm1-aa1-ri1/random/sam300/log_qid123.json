Then there was a follow-up question about other people or structures, and the response was no. The revised answer combines both, stating there's one person and no others or structures.\n\nNow, the user's latest query is just \"Is there a person in the image?\" again. Since the revised answer confirms the presence of one person and the follow-up clarified no others, the answer should still be \"Yes\". I need to use the FinalAnswer function with the concise response. The previous revision already captures this, so the final answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nYes\n</FinalAnswer>"
