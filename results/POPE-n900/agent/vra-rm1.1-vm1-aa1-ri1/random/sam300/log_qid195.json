The user asked, \"Is there a horse in the image?\" \n\nLooking back at the conversation history, the initial answer said there are two horses in the background. Then there was a critique and a follow-up question to the vision model, which confirmed the horses are distinguishable by color. The revised answer included that detail, citing references.\n\nNow the user is prompting again with a system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function. The latest revision clearly states there are two horses with different colors in the background. The answer is concise and references the necessary points. \n\nI need to make sure the final answer is a direct \"Yes\" as per the user's instruction. The previous answers already confirmed the presence of horses, so the final answer should just be \"Yes\" using the specified function. No need for extra details since the question is a simple yes/no.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
