That clearly indicates people are present. The follow-up from the vision model specified there are 10 players and 1 spectator. \n\nThe revised answer states there are 11 people, confirming the presence. The user's final query is just \"Yes\" in the prompt, but they might be testing if I follow the instructions. Since the last revision already answered affirmatively with details, the correct response is \"Yes\" via the FinalAnswer function. No need for extra steps here.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
