Then the follow-up specified there are two benches arranged in a row. The revised answer correctly states \"Yes\" and cites the reference. Now, the user is prompting again with an empty message and a reminder to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nSince the last revision already answers the question clearly with \"Yes\" and the references are properly cited, I just need to encapsulate that into the FinalAnswer function. The answer is correct and concise, so no changes are needed. Just format it as specified.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nYes, there are two benches in the image [1].
