Let me check the latest information.\n\nIn the previous interaction, the vision model confirmed the vase is present, described as black, holding flowers. The material isn't certain, but the existence is clear. The user just wants a simple yes or no. So the answer should be \"Yes\".\n\nI need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Make sure to encapsulate it properly without extra text. Just the answer inside the function.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
