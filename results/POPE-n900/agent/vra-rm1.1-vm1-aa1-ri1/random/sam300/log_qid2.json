Then the vision model confirmed there are no phones. Now the user wants a final answer using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nThe revised answer already states no cell phone is present, citing the vision model. The references are properly listed. The new question about other accessories was asked, but since the user's current query is just \"Is there a cell phone in the image?\" again, I need to respond with the final answer. \n\nI should use the FinalAnswer function with the concise response \"No\" and include the reference. Wait, but the user's last input was just the question again. The system reminder says to directly answer using the FinalAnswer. So the answer remains \"No\" based on the vision model's confirmation. Need to format it correctly with the function and reference.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(\"No\", references=[\"vision_model\"])"
