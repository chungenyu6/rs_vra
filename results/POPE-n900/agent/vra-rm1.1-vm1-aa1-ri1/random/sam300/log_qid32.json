But then there was a tool call where the vision model's updated response said that utensils like spoons are visible. So the revised answer changed to \"Yes\" with reference [2].\n\nNow the user is prompting again with the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function. The last revision's answer was \"Yes\" based on the updated info from the vision model. The user's current query is just the system reminder, so I need to confirm the final answer considering the latest information.\n\nSince the vision model's second response confirmed spoons are present, the correct answer is \"Yes\". I should use the FinalAnswer function with that.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
