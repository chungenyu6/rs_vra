Then, when the user asked, I said no based on the description. The user then wanted a critique and a follow-up question to the vision model. The vision model confirmed there are no electronic screens or TVs. \n\nSo now, in the revised answer, it's clear that after checking again, there's definitely no TV. The references [1] and [2] back this up. The user's latest query just says \"Is there a tv in the image?\" again, so the answer remains no. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. \n\nWait, the system prompt says to use the FinalAnswer function. The previous answer was already \"No\" with references. Since the latest check confirms it again, the final answer should be \"No\" wrapped in the function. Got it.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
