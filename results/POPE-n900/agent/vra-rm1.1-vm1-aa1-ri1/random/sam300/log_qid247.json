Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nIn the initial description, the truck is mentioned as parked near the center, but there's no detail about its cargo. The follow-up question about the color was answered as white, but still no info on the cargo. Since the vision model hasn't provided any data about the cargo area's contents, I can't confirm if it's empty or loaded. I need to state that the available information doesn't include that detail. The answer should use the FinalAnswer function and stay within the word limit.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer> The provided visual information does not specify whether the white truck's cargo area is empty or loaded. </FinalAnswer>"
