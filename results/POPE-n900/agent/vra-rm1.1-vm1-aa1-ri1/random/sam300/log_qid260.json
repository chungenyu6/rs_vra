The initial answer said no, and then after some back-and-forth, the revised answer still says no, citing references. The latest query is a system prompt telling me to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision.\n\nLooking at the last revision, the answer clearly states there's no spoon, with references to the image description and follow-up. The user's current question is just the system reminder, so I need to encapsulate the final answer as \"No\" using the specified function. No new information has been introduced since the last check, so the answer remains the same.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
