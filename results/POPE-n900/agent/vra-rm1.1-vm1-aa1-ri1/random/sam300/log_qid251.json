The user's question was \"Is there a person in the image?\" The previous conversation shows that the initial answer was \"Yes\" with details about pedestrians. Then, after a tool call, the vision model specified a man with a backpack. The revised answer included that detail, citing reference [1].\n\nNow, the user is prompting again with an empty input, but looking at the history, the final answer should be based on the last revision. The last revision's answer clearly states a person (the man with a backpack) is present, so the answer remains \"Yes\". I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. The answer should be concise, just \"Yes\", since the question is straightforward and the references already confirm it. No need for extra details here.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
