To be thorough, I checked again by asking about fruits, and the response was negative. Now, I need to present the final answer using the FinalAnswer function. The revised answer already states there's no apple, referencing the initial description and the follow-up. So I'll just format that into the required function.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo apple is present. The image shows a tennis court with a player, spectators, potted plants, and chairs. A follow-up confirmed no fruits are visible.\n</FinalAnswer>"
