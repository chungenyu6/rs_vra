To be thorough, I checked again by asking the vision model about vehicles or large objects in the background. The vision model confirmed there are none, reiterating the focus is on the woman, baby, and cake. So, there's definitely no truck. The answer should be a straightforward \"No\".\n</think>\n\n**FinalAnswer**  \nNo"
