Since the data confirms some boys have ties, the answer is yes. The final answer should encapsulate the revised information concisely. \n\nFinal check: The user wants a direct answer. The previous steps established the count, so the answer remains \"Yes\" with the reference. No need for extra details unless required. The instruction says to use FinalAnswer, so format accordingly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes, 10 out of the 24 boys in the image are wearing ties.</FinalAnswer>"
