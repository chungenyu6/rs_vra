The critique suggested considering the warm climate from the palm trees. Then, a follow-up question checked for sports equipment, and the vision model confirmed there's none. \n\nNow, the revised answer includes references to the city scene and absence of sports gear. The next step was to ask about vehicles carrying large objects. The user's latest query is just the system prompt, so I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n\nWait, the user's last message is an empty input, but the system reminder says to directly answer using FinalAnswer. Since the question was already addressed and the latest tool response confirmed no sports equipment, the answer remains \"No.\" I should format it properly with the function.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No, there is no snowboard in the image. The scene depicts a busy city street with cars, traffic lights, and palm trees, and no sports equipment or items in people\u2019s possession are visible.</FinalAnswer>"
