Then, after a follow-up, the vision model specified that there's a knife on top of the pizza and another next to it. The revised answer incorporated that detail, citing the references. Now, the user is prompting again with the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nI need to make sure the answer is concise and uses the FinalAnswer format. The latest information from the vision model clearly states there are knives, specifically one on the pizza and another next to it. So the answer should be \"Yes,\" and then include the details from the references. Let me check the references again to ensure accuracy. The references [1] come from the vision model's latest input, which is the most current data. \n\nI should structure it as a direct \"Yes\" answer, mentioning the knives' positions as per the provided information. Keep it under 50 words and properly cite the sources. Alright, that should cover it.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, there are knives in the image. One is positioned on top of the pizza [1], and another is placed next to it [1], likely for slicing."
