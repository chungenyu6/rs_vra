Let me check the history.\n\nInitially, I said no because the original description didn't mention it. But then the vision model pointed out there is one in the background. So the updated answer should be yes, citing the vision model's input. The user's latest query is the same as before, so I need to provide the revised answer with the confirmation from the vision model. The final answer should use the FinalAnswer function and include the reference. Also, the color question was asked next, but the user hasn't answered that yet. So focus on the current question first. Just need to state yes with the citation.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes, there is a refrigerator visible in the background of the image [1].)  \n\n**References**  \n[1] vision_model: \"Yes, there is a refrigerator visible in the background of the image.\""
