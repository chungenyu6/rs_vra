The user asked, \"Is there a snowboard in the image?\" \n\nFirst, looking at the initial description provided, it mentions a person skiing with skis and another person watching. The first answer was \"No\" because the description didn't mention a snowboard. But then the vision model's response clarified that there is a snowboard near the second person. \n\nThe user then provided an updated answer based on that vision model input, changing the answer to \"Yes\" with a reference. Now, the user is asking again, and I need to check if there's any new information. \n\nThe latest exchange includes a reference to the vision model's confirmation, so the correct answer should be \"Yes\" as per the updated info. The system prompt says to use the FinalAnswer function directly. I should ensure the answer is based on the last revision which includes the vision model's input. \n\nNo new data since the last update, so sticking with \"Yes\" is correct.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
