The initial answer said no, based on the description of a bakery with donuts and no mention of sports gear. Then the assistant followed up by asking the vision model again, which confirmed no sports objects. The revised answer uses references to the bakery display and the vision model's confirmation.\n\nNow, the user's latest input is just \"Is there a tennis racket in the image?\" again. The system reminder says to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision. The last revision's revised answer clearly states no tennis racket is present, referencing both the initial description and the vision model's check. So the final answer should just be \"No\" wrapped in the FinalAnswer function. Make sure to follow the exact format specified.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo\n</FinalAnswer>"
