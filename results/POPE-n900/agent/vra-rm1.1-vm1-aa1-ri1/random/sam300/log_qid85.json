Let me check the conversation history.\n\nThe initial answer said yes, with at least nine people. Then there were follow-ups, but the latest tool response mentions several people near the bus. Even the latest question about the bus doors doesn't negate the presence of people. So the answer is definitely yes. I need to respond with 'Yes' using the FinalAnswer function.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
