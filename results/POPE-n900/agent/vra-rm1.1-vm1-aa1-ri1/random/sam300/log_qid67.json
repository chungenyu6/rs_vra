Let me check the conversation history.\n\nInitially, I answered yes, mentioning customers and a possible staff member. The vision model then clarified that there are both customers and staff. The revised answer included that, citing the sources. Now the user is asking again, but the system prompt says to use the FinalAnswer function. \n\nWait, the latest exchange shows the user provided the vision model's response [3], which confirmed staff and customers. The revised answer already incorporated that. The user's current input is just the system reminder. Since the question has been answered, I need to provide the final answer using the specified function. \n\nThe user might be testing if I follow the instructions to use the FinalAnswer. The correct response is \"Yes\" based on all the provided information. So I should format it as FinalAnswer: Yes.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
