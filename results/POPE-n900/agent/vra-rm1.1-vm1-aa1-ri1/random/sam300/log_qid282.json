Then, when asked about appliances in the background, the vision model confirmed there are none, with a white wall behind. The revised answer already states there's no oven, citing the references. The latest query is a reminder to use the FinalAnswer function directly.\n\nSo the user wants a concise yes or no. Since all provided info says no oven is present, the answer is \"No\". I need to make sure not to add extra info, just the final answer as per the instruction.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer{No}"
