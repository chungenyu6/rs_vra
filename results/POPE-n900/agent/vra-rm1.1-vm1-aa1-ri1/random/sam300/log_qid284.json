The initial description provided by the assistant mentioned a wooden table with pizza, broccoli, a knife, bowls, and a cup, but no elephant. Then, when the user followed up, the vision model confirmed there are no large animals or unusual objects. The revised answer used references to back up the \"No\" answer. Now, the user is prompting again with the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision.\n\nThe last revision from ReviseAnswer clearly states there's no elephant and lists the references. So I need to present the final answer using the specified function. The answer should be concise, incorporating the references provided. Let me make sure I don't add any extra information beyond what's already established. Just confirm \"No\" with the references mentioned.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No elephant is present [1][2][3]. The image confirms a domestic scene with a pizza, utensils, and kitchen items, excluding large animals.</FinalAnswer>"
