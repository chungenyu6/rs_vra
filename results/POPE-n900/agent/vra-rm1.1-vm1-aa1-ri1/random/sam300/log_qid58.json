The initial answer said no, and then after checking further, they confirmed there are no utensils, tables, or food items. So putting it all together, the final answer should clearly state that there's no spoon, backed by the two references provided. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Just make sure to keep it concise and reference the sources properly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: No, there is no spoon in the image. The scene depicts a tennis match with no utensils, food, or unrelated objects present [1][2]."
