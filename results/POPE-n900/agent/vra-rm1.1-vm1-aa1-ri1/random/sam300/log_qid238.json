Then, after some back-and-forth and checks with the vision model, the final answer still says no, with references to both the initial description and the vision model's confirmation.\n\nNow the user is prompting again with an empty message and a reminder to use the FinalAnswer function. Since the last revision already addressed all points and the answer is consistent, I just need to present the final answer as instructed. No new information has come up, so the answer remains \"No.\"\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer{No}"
