Then there was a critique asking for more details like size and text visibility. The vision model provided confirmation that there are indeed two books, specifying their positions, sizes, and that text is visible.\n\nThe revised answer incorporated that info, citing the vision model. The user's final query is just a checkmark, which probably means they want a concise yes/no answer now, using the FinalAnswer function. \n\nSince the revised answer already confirms there are two books, the direct answer should be \"Yes\" enclosed in the FinalAnswer tag. No need for extra details here since the user might be seeking a simple confirmation after the discussion.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
