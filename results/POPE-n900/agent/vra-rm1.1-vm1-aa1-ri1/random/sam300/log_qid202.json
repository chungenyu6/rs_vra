The first answer was no, based on the description of a dining scene. Then, the assistant followed up by asking the vision model about beach-related items or surfboard-like objects. The vision model confirmed there are none. Now, the user is prompting again with the \"FinalAnswer\" function.\n\nThe user's latest input is just a line of asterisks, but the system reminder says to answer directly using the FinalAnswer function. The previous answer already concluded there's no surfboard, supported by references. Since there's no new information contradicting that, the final answer should be \"No\" with the same references. Need to format it correctly using the function.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(No)"
