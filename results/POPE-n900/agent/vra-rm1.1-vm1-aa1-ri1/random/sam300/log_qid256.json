The visual information from the tool response [1] explicitly states there are no animals or large objects besides the skiers. \n\nThe assistant's revised answer already confirms no horse is present, citing the reference. Since the user's latest input includes the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function and the information hasn't changed, the answer remains \"No.\" No new details suggest a horse is present, so the response is straightforward.\n\nNeed to ensure the FinalAnswer is concise and uses the function as instructed. The answer should be \"No\" based on the given references.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
