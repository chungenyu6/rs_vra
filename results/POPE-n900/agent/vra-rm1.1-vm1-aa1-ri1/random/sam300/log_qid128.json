Then, the vision model confirmed there are no animals like dogs. The revised answer included that reference. Now, the user is repeating the question. Since the vision model already checked and confirmed there's no dog, the answer remains no. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Just need to make sure the response is concise and uses the function properly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
