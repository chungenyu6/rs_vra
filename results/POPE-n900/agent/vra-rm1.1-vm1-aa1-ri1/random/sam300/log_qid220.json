The revised answer mentions the scoreboard but notes that a clock isn't explicitly stated. The user wants a direct yes or no. \n\nThe key point: The scoreboard's presence doesn't automatically mean a clock is there. Since the vision model didn't mention a clock, the answer should still be no. But the scoreboard is there, which might imply a clock, but without confirmation, I have to stick to the data provided. \n\nSo the final answer is \"No\" because the clock isn't explicitly mentioned even with the scoreboard present.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: No"
