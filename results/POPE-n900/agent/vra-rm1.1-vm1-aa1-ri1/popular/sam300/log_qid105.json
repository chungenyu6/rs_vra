The revised answer mentioned both players and possibly others like coaches. Now the user is asking again, probably to confirm the presence of people. Since all responses confirm people are there, the final answer should be \"Yes\" using the FinalAnswer function. I need to make sure to just say \"Yes\" without extra details now.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
