Then, after a follow-up question to the vision model, it was found that there are two handbags. The revised answer included that info with references. Now the user is prompting again with the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nThe user's current query is just \"Yes\" in the system message, but looking back, maybe they want the final answer to the original question. The original question was whether there's a handbag. The latest info from the vision model says yes, two handbags. So the final answer should be \"Yes\" with the details from the references. Need to make sure it's concise and uses the FinalAnswer function properly. Also, check if any further details are needed, like the locations mentioned. The user might want a straightforward yes with the count and locations. Alright, time to format the answer correctly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes, there are two handbags visible: one near a person walking away from the buses and another near the bench where people are sitting.</FinalAnswer>"
