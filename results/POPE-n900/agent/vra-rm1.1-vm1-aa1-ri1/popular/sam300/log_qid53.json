Now the user is prompting again with the FinalAnswer function.\n\nLooking back at the information provided: the tool response stated one phone is obscured by the sandwich, the other isn't. The original image description mentioned two phones. The references are correctly cited. Since the question was about the presence of a cell phone, even though one is obscured, there are still two present. The answer should confirm \"Yes\" because the user's original question was simply whether there's a cell phone, not about their visibility. However, the revised answer already states there are two. But the user wants a direct yes/no. Wait, the user's latest query is just \"Is there a cell phone in the image?\" again. So the answer is definitely yes. The previous details about two phones and one being obscured support that. So the FinalAnswer should be \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
