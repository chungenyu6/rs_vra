But then the vision model's response broke it down into four specific individuals and mentioned others. The revised answer acknowledged four main people and others scattered around. Now the user is prompting to finalize the answer using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nThe user's latest query is just the question again: \"Is there a person in the image?\" So I need to confirm based on the updated info. The vision model's details clearly show multiple people, even if the exact count is uncertain. The key point is that there are people present. The final answer should be a straightforward \"Yes\" with the references from the latest visual info. The previous answer's references (like [1]-[4]) should be cited. I need to make sure the answer is concise and uses the FinalAnswer syntax as instructed.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, people are present. Four individuals are specifically noted: a man with a suitcase moving toward the train [1], another near the train [2], a woman and child walking nearby [3], and others scattered around [4]."
