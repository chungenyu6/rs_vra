From the previous conversation, the initial answer was no, and after a follow-up check specifically looking for vehicles, the vision model also said no. The revised answer correctly states there's no car, citing both sources. The user's latest query is just \"Is there a car in the image?\" again. Since all the information points to the absence of a car, the final answer should be \"No\".\n\nI need to make sure I'm using the FinalAnswer function as instructed. The references are already handled in the last revision, so just a straightforward \"No\" here. No new information has been provided that contradicts the previous conclusions. Yep, that's it.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
