Let me check the latest information.\n\nIn the previous interaction, the vision model confirmed there are no vehicles in the background. The scene is a celebration with people, a table, cake, and a baby. No cars were mentioned in any of the descriptions provided. The references also support that there's no car. So the answer should be \"No\".\n\nI need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. The response should be concise, just \"No\" since that's the direct answer. No need for extra details here.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: No"
