Let me check the previous interactions.\n\nIn the first response, the assistant mentioned a man sitting in a chair and others seated on chairs. Then, after the user's feedback, the revised answer stated there are two chairs: one occupied, one empty. The references cited the vision model's response and the initial description.\n\nNow, the user is repeating the question \"Is there a chair in the image?\" but wants a direct yes or no answer using the FinalAnswer function. Since the previous answers confirmed chairs exist, the answer is clearly yes. I need to make sure not to add extra details, just a straightforward \"Yes\" as per the instruction.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
