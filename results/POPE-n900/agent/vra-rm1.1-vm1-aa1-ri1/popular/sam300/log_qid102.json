Then, when I asked the vision model again specifically about bowl-shaped objects, it confirmed there aren't any. The revised answer combines both sources and concludes no bowl is present. The references back up this conclusion. Since the user's question is straightforward, the final answer should be \"No\" based on the provided evidence. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo\n</FinalAnswer>"
