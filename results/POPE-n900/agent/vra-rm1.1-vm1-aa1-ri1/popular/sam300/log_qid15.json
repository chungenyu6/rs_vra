But then the vision model pointed out a bicycle parked near the riverbank. So the revised answer says there is a bicycle, citing the new information from the vision model as reference [2]. The user now wants the final answer using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nI need to make sure to confirm the presence of the bicycle based on the updated info from the vision model. The correct answer now should be \"Yes\" since the vision model's input is considered accurate. The references should include both the original description and the vision model's clarification. The final answer should be straightforward, using the Yes/No format as per the initial instructions but incorporating the revised info. Wait, the user's latest query just shows the system reminder, so I need to respond with the FinalAnswer function. The previous revised answer already says yes, so the final answer is yes.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
