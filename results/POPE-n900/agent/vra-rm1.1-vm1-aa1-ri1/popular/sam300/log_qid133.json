Then, after checking further with the vision model, it confirmed there are no other people besides those two. So the answer should still be yes because there are two women present. The user's question was straightforward, just asking if there's a person, not specifying the number. So even though there are two, the answer is still yes. The references are already given, and the latest information doesn't change the presence of people. Just need to confirm the presence, which is there. So the final answer should be \"Yes\" with the references.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, the image contains two women walking together, with no additional people present [1][3]."
