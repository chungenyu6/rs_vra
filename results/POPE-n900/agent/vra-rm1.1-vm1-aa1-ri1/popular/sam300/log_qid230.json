Initially, the answer was no because the description mentioned benches but no tables. But then the vision model clarified that there are two benches around a small table. So the answer should now be yes. \n\nThe user wants the final answer to use the FinalAnswer function. The previous response already updated to \"Yes\" and included references. The latest instruction says to directly answer using FinalAnswer, so I need to make sure the response is concise and uses that format.\n\nWait, the user's last message shows a system prompt reminding to use the FinalAnswer function. The previous assistant's message had the answer as \"Yes\" with references and a question. But now, since the user is asking again, perhaps they want the final answer without the extra parts. \n\nThe correct approach here is to provide the final answer in the specified format. Since the vision model confirmed the table's presence, the answer is \"Yes\". No need for references or further questions now. Just the FinalAnswer function with \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
