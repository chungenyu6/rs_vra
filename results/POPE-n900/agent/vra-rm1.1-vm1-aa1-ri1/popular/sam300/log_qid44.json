Then, after some back-and-forth and checking with the vision model, which also said \"No,\" the final answer was provided with references. The user now wants the final answer using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nI need to make sure I'm following the instructions correctly. The last revision already concluded there's no car, citing the vision model. The system prompt says to use the FinalAnswer function now. So I should just restate the conclusion concisely without extra details. The references are already included in the previous steps, but maybe the user wants a straightforward \"No\" as the final answer. Let me check the example they gave. The example uses FinalAnswer with just the answer. So I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
