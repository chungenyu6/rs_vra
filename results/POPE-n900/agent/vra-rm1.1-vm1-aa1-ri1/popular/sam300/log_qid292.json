Then, after the vision model checked for vehicles, it confirmed there are none. The revised answer clearly states no car is present, citing the references. Since all sources agree there's no car, the answer is straightforward. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Just need to make sure the response is a simple \"No\" as per the user's initial request, but also include the references from the revised answer. Wait, the user's final instruction says to directly answer with 'Yes' or 'No' without extra info. Hmm, but the revised answer includes references. Maybe the user wants just \"No\" now. Let me check the exact instructions again.\n\nThe user's first message said: \"Directly answer with 'Yes' or 'No' to the user's question without output your thinking process.\" But later, after revisions, there were references. However, the latest reminder says to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision. The last revision's answer was \"No car is present...\" but the user might expect a simple \"No\". But the references are part of the process. Wait, the user's last instruction says to \"Directly answer the user's question based on the last revision. Respond with FinalAnswer function.\" The last revision's answer was \"No car is present...\" but perhaps the user wants just \"No\" as the final answer, using the references internally. So I should output \"No\" via FinalAnswer, incorporating the references in the function's parameters if needed. But the example might just need the answer. Let me proceed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo\n</FinalAnswer>"
