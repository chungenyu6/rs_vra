But then the vision model provided new info: there's a skier with orange pants and a yellow jacket. So I revised the answer to yes, citing the orange pants. Now the user is prompting again with just \"Yes\" and some formatting. Wait, the user's latest input is just \"Yes\" enclosed in their message? Let me check the history again.\n\nLooking back, the user first asked about an orange in the image. The initial image description didn't mention orange, so I answered no. Then the user provided a tool response indicating there is an orange object (the skier's pants). I revised the answer to yes. Now the user's latest message is just \"Yes\" followed by the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function. Maybe they're confirming or testing? The user's current query might be a test of whether I can finalize the answer properly. Since the last revision confirmed the orange pants exist, the final answer should be \"Yes\" using the specified function. Need to make sure to encapsulate it correctly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
