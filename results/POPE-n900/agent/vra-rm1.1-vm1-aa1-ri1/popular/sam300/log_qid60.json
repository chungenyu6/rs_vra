The initial description mentioned a tennis court scene with a woman playing tennis, other people, potted plants, and chairs but no handbag. Then I checked with the vision model, which confirmed there are no handbags near the chairs or spectators. So putting it all together, the answer is no. Need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Make sure to include references properly.\n\nWait, the user's last message was just \"No...\" which was the vision model's response. The assistant then went through a process and now needs to finalize. The revised answer already says \"No handbag is present in the image [1][2].\" with references. The system prompt says to use FinalAnswer. So the final answer should be wrapped in that function. Also check word count. The answer is short enough. Alright, that's it.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer[No handbag is present in the image [1][2].]  \n\n**References**:  \n[1] Initial scene description.  \n[2] Vision model's confirmation of no handbags near chairs/spectators."
