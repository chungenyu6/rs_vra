Now, the user wants a final answer using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nLooking back, the latest version confirmed people are present, mentioning players and bystanders with citations. The critique streamlined it. The vision model's response included bystanders near the fence, so the answer should stick to that. No new info about uniforms was provided, so the final answer should just confirm the presence of people as established.\n\nNeed to use the FinalAnswer format. The answer should be concise, yes, and reference the key points from the last revision. Make sure not to add extra details beyond what's already confirmed.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, people are present in the image. Active players (e.g., batter, catcher) and bystanders near the fence are visible [1][2]."
