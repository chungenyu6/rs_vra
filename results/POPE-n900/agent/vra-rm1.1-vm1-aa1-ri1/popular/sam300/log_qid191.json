The latest tool response mentioned both motorized and traditional rowing boats. The user's latest query is just a repetition of the original question, so I need to confirm again based on the updated information.\n\nThe FinalAnswer needs to be a simple \"Yes\" as all responses so far confirm the presence of boats. The references are already cited in the last revision. I should just output \"Yes\" using the specified function.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
