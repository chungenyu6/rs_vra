Then after some back-and-forth and additional info about a hidden bus, the revised answer still confirms cars are there. The latest question from the user is just \"Yes\" or \"No\", but looking at the history, they might still need a concise answer.\n\nWait, the user's latest input is just \"Yes\" followed by the system reminder. Oh, maybe there was a formatting error. The user's actual question is still whether there's a car. The latest answer from the vision model mentioned a hidden bus but didn't contradict the presence of cars. So the answer should still be \"Yes\" based on the initial description. The final answer needs to be a direct \"Yes\" using the FinalAnswer function. I need to make sure not to add extra info beyond the user's question. Since the user just wants a yes/no, the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
