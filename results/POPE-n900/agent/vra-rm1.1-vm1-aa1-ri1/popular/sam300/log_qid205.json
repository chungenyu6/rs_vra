The assistant then went through several revisions, incorporating details like the number of people (5 riders) from the vision model's response. The latest answer still says \"Yes\" and cites references, but the user now wants the final answer using the FinalAnswer function without any extra text.\n\nThe key here is to adhere strictly to the user's latest instruction: answer directly with \"Yes\" or \"No\" using the FinalAnswer format. The previous detailed answers are part of the thinking process, but the final response must be concise.\n\nSince the vision model confirmed there are 5 people riding elephants, the correct answer is \"Yes\". I need to make sure to present it exactly as instructed, without any additional explanations or formatting.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
