Then the vision model provided more details: a large commercial truck near buildings. The revised answer included that info with a citation.\n\nNow the user is prompting again with the \"FinalAnswer\" function. I need to make sure the final answer is concise and incorporates all verified info. The last revision already states the truck's type, location, and purpose. Since the user wants the final answer, I should present it clearly without extra formatting. Check if all necessary parts are there: confirmation of the truck, details from the vision model, and proper citation. Yes, that's covered. So the final answer should be the revised version but formatted correctly with the function.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer:A large commercial truck is present, parked near buildings on the roadside [1]."
