From the initial description provided, the image has a kitchen with a dining table mentioned explicitly. The follow-up specified it's white and wooden. The revised answer included those details with citations. The latest query is a system prompt to answer directly using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nWait, the user's last input was a system reminder to use FinalAnswer. The assistant's previous message included a revised answer and references. Now, the user might want the final answer formatted properly. Since the question was already answered as \"Yes\" with details, the FinalAnswer should confirm that. I need to make sure to use the function exactly as instructed. The answer is yes, so the FinalAnswer is \"Yes\" based on the references provided earlier. No new info suggests otherwise. Just need to present it correctly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
