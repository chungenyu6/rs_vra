Let me check the previous conversation.\n\nOriginally, the image description mentioned two cars parked nearby. The revised answer specified they're near a bridge close to the docking area, citing references [1] and [2]. The latest query from the user is just \"Yes,\" but looking at the system prompt, I need to use the FinalAnswer function. \n\nWait, the user's last input was the system reminder, and the actual question was already answered. The user might be confirming the presence of cars again. Since the information from the vision model confirmed the cars' presence near the bridge, the answer remains \"Yes.\" I should format it with FinalAnswer as instructed.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, there are two cars parked near a bridge close to the docking area."
