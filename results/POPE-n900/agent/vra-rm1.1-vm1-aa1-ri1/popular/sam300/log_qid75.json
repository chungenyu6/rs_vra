Let me look at the history.\n\nPreviously, the user asked the same question, and the answer was \"Yes\" with references to the visual data. The assistant then added more details about the broccoli's location after getting more info from a follow-up question to the vision model. Now, the user is repeating the question, maybe expecting a concise answer now that all details are gathered.\n\nThe FinalAnswer needs to be a direct yes or no. Since the image description and the vision model both confirm broccoli's presence, the answer remains \"Yes\". But according to the instructions, I must use the FinalAnswer function. Also, the user mentioned to \"respond with FinalAnswer function\" so I should structure it properly.\n\nWait, the user's last message ends with \"FinalAnswer: broccoli is present\", but in the current query, they are asking again. The system prompt says to directly answer using FinalAnswer. The previous answer had references, but maybe now it's just a simple yes. Let me check the exact instructions again.\n\nThe user's final instruction says: \"Directly answer the user's question based on the last revision. Respond with FinalAnswer function.\" The last revision included the broccoli's presence. So the answer is yes. The FinalAnswer should be \"Yes\" inside the function. I need to make sure there's no extra text, just the function call with the answer.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
