But then the vision model provided new info: someone is wearing a handbag while riding the elephant. So I revised my answer to confirm the handbag's presence, citing the vision model's input.\n\nNow, the user's latest query is just \"Handbag\". They probably want a straightforward yes or no based on the updated info. Since the vision model clearly stated the handbag exists, the answer should be \"Yes\". I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. No need for extra details here, just the concise answer.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
