But then the user used the vision model, which found a spoon on a shelf. So I updated the answer to yes with a citation. Now the user is asking again, probably expecting the latest answer. The last revision already says the spoon is there. I need to confirm with the FinalAnswer function. The answer should be \"Yes\" based on the vision model's input. Just make sure to use the correct syntax.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer:Yes"
