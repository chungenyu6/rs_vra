Let me check the latest details. \n\nIn the previous exchange, the vision model mentioned three cell phones: one held by a woman, another used by a man at a table, and a third on a nearby surface. The revised answer clearly states there are three phones. \n\nThe user's current query is a direct yes/no question. Since there are multiple phones, the answer is definitely \"Yes.\" I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. No need for extra details here since the question is straightforward. Just confirm the presence.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
