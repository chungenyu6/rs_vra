But then the vision model pointed out there are actually two bottles near the pizza. So I need to correct my previous answer. The user probably wants a straightforward yes or no, so I should just confirm that there are bottles now. The references show the vision model's input, so I have to trust that. Final answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>  \nYes, there are two bottles visible on the table near the pizza.  \n</FinalAnswer>"
