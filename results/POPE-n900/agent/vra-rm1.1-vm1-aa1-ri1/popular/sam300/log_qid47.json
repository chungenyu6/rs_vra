Let me check the conversation history.\n\nPreviously, the assistant said there are three white bowls: two empty and one with cereal and milk, based on the vision model's input [1]. The user's latest query is the same as before: \"Is there a bowl in the image?\" \n\nSince the vision model confirmed three bowls exist, the answer is definitely yes. The answer needs to be a straightforward \"Yes\" as per the user's instruction, without extra details. The user emphasized to answer with 'Yes' or 'No' directly. So I should just respond \"Yes\" using the FinalAnswer function.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
