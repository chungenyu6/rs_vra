But then the vision model confirmed there's a tennis ball near the woman. So the correct answer should be \"Yes\" since the vision model's input now confirms the ball's presence. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Just have to make sure to respond with \"FinalAnswer(Yes)\" without any extra text.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
