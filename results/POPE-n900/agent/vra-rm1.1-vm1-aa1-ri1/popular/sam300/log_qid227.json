The first answer confirmed that the main person is on skis, and the second person is on a snowboard. Then the user's next question through the tool was asking if both people are wearing skis. The vision model response clarified that the secondary person is on a snowboard, not skis.\n\nNow, the user is prompting again with the context, and I need to provide the final answer using the FinalAnswer function. The key point here is that only the main person has skis; the other has a snowboard. So the answer should clearly state that only one person has skis. I need to make sure the response is concise and accurate based on the provided information. Let me structure it properly with the function call.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"FinalAnswer\", \"content\": \"No, only the main person is wearing skis.
