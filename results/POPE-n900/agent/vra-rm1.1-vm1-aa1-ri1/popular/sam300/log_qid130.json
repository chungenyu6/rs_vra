Then I got a follow-up from the vision model confirming that there are no handbags on the background people or near the car. Now the user is prompting again with the FinalAnswer function.\n\nI need to make sure I use the FinalAnswer format. The previous revised answer already concluded there's no handbag, citing both sources. Since the latest information from the vision model [2] supports that, the final answer should be a straightforward \"No\" wrapped in the function. No need for extra details since the user just wants the answer now.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
