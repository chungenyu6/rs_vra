The vision model's previous response mentioned two surfboards: one in the water with a man riding it and another on the shore. But the user now wants to know about other objects near them.\n\nLooking back at the initial image description provided earlier, the details given were about the people and the surfboards. The original scene description didn't mention anything about towels, coolers, or other objects. The spectators are present, but there's no info on their belongings. Since the vision model's last answer also didn't report any such items, I should conclude that there's no mention of towels or coolers. So the answer should be no, but I need to check if the latest information from the vision model includes that. Wait, the user's last input was the vision model's answer about the two surfboards, and now the user's current question is about additional objects. Since the vision model hasn't provided info on towels or coolers, the answer is no. I need to use the FinalAnswer function to respond.\n</think>\n\n{\"name\": \"FinalAnswer\", \"arguments\": {\"answer\": \"No, there are no towels, coolers, or additional objects mentioned near the surfboards in the image.\"}}"
