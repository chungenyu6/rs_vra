The references confirm their positions and that they're open without visible text. The answer is concise and sticks to the key points, removing any extra details like the cup. \n\nI need to make sure the final answer is a simple \"Yes\" as the user requested a direct answer. The previous answers provided more details, but the user now wants just the confirmation. The revised answer already confirms multiple books, so the final answer should be straightforward.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
