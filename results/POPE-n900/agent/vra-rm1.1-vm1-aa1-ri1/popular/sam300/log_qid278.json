Then the user, acting as a system, asked a follow-up question through the vision model to check for any human figures in the background or edges. The vision model's answer confirmed there are none, mentioning the focus is on the vase and the white wall.\n\nNow, the user is prompting again with the same initial question, but the context includes the follow-up exchange. Since both the initial description and the subsequent check via the vision model rule out any people, the answer remains no. The final answer should be straightforward, using the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Need to make sure not to add extra information beyond what's provided. Just confirm that there's no person in the image based on the given data.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
