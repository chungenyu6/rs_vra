Then, they asked a follow-up question about the cat's fur color. I used the vision model to get that info, and the response was \"black and white.\" Now, the user's current query is just the system prompt to answer based on the last revision. The last revision includes the fur color answer. So, I need to use the FinalAnswer function to state the color clearly. The answer should be straightforward: \"The cat's fur is black and white.\" That's it.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nThe cat's fur is black and white.\n</FinalAnswer>"
