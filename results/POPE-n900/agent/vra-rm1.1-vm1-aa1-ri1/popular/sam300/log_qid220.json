But then the vision model pointed out that there are cars parked around the field. So in the revised answer, I updated to say yes, citing the visual info. Now the user is asking again, so I need to confirm based on the latest information. The final answer should be yes, using the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Make sure to include the citation again for accuracy.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, there are cars parked around the baseball field [1].  \n\n**References**:  \n[1] visual information here"
