The vision model's follow-up specified that they're all silver. The revised answer confirmed the cars' presence and color. Since the user's question is straightforward\u2014just asking if a car exists in the image\u2014the answer is definitely \"Yes.\" The references [1] and [2] back this up. No need for extra details unless asked, but the question is simple. So the final answer should be \"Yes\" using the FinalAnswer format.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, there are silver cars parked near the soccer field."
