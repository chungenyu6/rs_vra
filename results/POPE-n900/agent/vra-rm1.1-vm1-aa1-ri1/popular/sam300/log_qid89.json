Then, after a follow-up, it was clarified that there are two buses, one yellow and one green, and no other vehicles. The revised answer combines both sources, specifying the colors and absence of other vehicles.\n\nThe user's question is straightforward: just whether a bus exists in the image. The answer is clearly yes, with two buses. The FinalAnswer needs to be concise, so I'll state that there are two buses (yellow and green) without extra details. The references are already handled in the revision, so no need to repeat them here. Just a direct \"Yes\" with the key details.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, there are two buses (one yellow and one green) in the image. No other vehicles are present."
