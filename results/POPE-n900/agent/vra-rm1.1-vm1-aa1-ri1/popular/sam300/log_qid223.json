    "final_answer": "<think>\nOkay, let me see. The user asked if there's a snowboard in the image. The previous conversation shows that the assistant first mentioned the snowboard's location in the bottom-left corner. Then there was a reflection pointing out that the answer should clarify the difference between skis and the snowboard. The assistant then asked the vision model to confirm the object, which confirmed it's a snowboard.\n\nNow, the user's latest query is just \"Yes\" or \"No\" to the original question. Since the vision model confirmed the presence of a snowboard, the correct answer is \"Yes\". The user wants a direct response without any extra details, just \"Yes\" or \"No\". So I should output \"Yes\" using the FinalAnswer function.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
