However, the details about the suitcases' open/closed state or their contents weren't explicitly mentioned in the previous answers or vision model responses. \n\nThe first answer confirmed the number and positions of the suitcases but didn't address their openness. The follow-up from the vision model discussed labels and handles (yellow tag, small box) but still didn't mention if they're open or have visible contents. \n\nSince there's no information provided about the suitcases being open or having visible items inside, the correct response should state that this detail isn't described in the given data. The answer needs to be concise, using the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The description does not mention whether the suitcases are open or closed, nor does it specify any visible contents inside them."
