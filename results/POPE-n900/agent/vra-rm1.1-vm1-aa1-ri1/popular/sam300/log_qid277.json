Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nIn the initial description from the vision model, the table was mentioned as \"wooden table\" without specifics on its finish. The follow-up about the vase's color and shape didn't mention the table's texture. The revised answer includes the table but still no details on polish or matte. Since there's no visual data provided about the table's surface finish, I can't confirm. I need to state that the information isn't available in the provided descriptions.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer> The provided descriptions do not specify whether the wooden table is polished or matte.</FinalAnswer>"
