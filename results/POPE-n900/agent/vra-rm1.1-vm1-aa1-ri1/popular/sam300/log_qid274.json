The previous answers mentioned there's a dining table with a bowl and a book, but the material wasn't specified. The initial description didn't mention the table's material, and the follow-up from the vision model only confirmed the table's existence and the items' placement. There's no data on the table's material in the provided references. So I can't determine the material from the given info. I should state that it's not specified.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The material of the dining table is not specified in the provided information."
