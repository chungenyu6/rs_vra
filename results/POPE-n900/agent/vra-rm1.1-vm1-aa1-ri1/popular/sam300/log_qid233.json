The final answer should confirm the presence of ties. Since some boys have ties, the answer is yes. The references and previous steps support this. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Just need to make sure it's a direct \"Yes\" response without extra details now.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
