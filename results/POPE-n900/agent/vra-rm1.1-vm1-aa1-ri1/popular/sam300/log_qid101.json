Then the vision model specified two cars: a red one on the left and a blue one further down. The revised answer confirmed two cars with their colors and positions. The user now wants a direct yes/no answer using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nSince the image clearly has two cars, the answer is definitely yes. I need to make sure to use the FinalAnswer format as instructed. No need for extra details here, just a straightforward \"Yes\" wrapped in the required function.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer[Yes]"
