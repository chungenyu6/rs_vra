But then the vision model provided new info confirming a wooden dining table exists. So the correct answer now is yes, based on the updated information from the tool response. I need to use the FinalAnswer function and reference the source properly.\n\nWait, the user's last message was just \"Yes\" after my revised answer. Maybe they're confirming, but according to the instructions, I should use the FinalAnswer format now. The latest info from the vision model in the tool response (cited as [1]) says the table is there. So the answer must be yes with the citation.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes, there is a wooden dining table in the kitchen [1].</FinalAnswer>"
