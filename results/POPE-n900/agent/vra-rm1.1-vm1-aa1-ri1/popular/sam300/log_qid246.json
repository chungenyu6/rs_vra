The user's question was \"Is there a bowl in the image?\" and the latest information from the vision model says that there are no bowls in the foreground but some people are carrying bowls. So the answer should now be \"Yes\" because the bowls are present but maybe not in the foreground. The previous answer had said \"No\" but after the vision model's update, it's corrected. I need to make sure to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. The user also wants a direct answer based on the last revision. The last revision's answer was \"Yes\" with references. So the correct response here is \"Yes\".\n\nWait, the user's latest input is just the system prompt, but the actual question remains the same. The user hasn't added new info except the system reminder. The vision model's last input confirmed bowls carried by pedestrians. So the final answer should be \"Yes\" wrapped in the FinalAnswer function.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
