Then, after a follow-up query to the vision model, it specified there are two handbags: one being carried and another on the ground.\n\nNow, the user wants the final answer using the FinalAnswer function. The last revision already states there are two handbags with references. The latest instruction says to directly answer based on the last revision. The answer should be \"Yes\" since the handbags are confirmed. I need to format it correctly with the FinalAnswer function, including the answer and references. Make sure it's concise and matches the required structure.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes, there are two handbags in the image: one carried by a pedestrian on the sidewalk [2], and another placed on the ground nearby [2].)"
