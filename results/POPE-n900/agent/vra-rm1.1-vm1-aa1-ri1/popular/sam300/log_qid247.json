Let me check the history. \n\nInitially, I answered \"No\" based on the text description provided, which mentioned buses and cars but not trucks. Then I asked the vision model, which confirmed there are trucks. In the revised answer, I updated to \"Trucks are present...\" citing the vision model's input.\n\nNow, the user is asking again. The final answer should reflect the corrected information from the vision model. Since the vision model confirmed trucks are present, the answer should be \"Yes\". Need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Also, keep it concise without extra details since the user just wants a direct yes/no.\n\nSo the final answer is \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
