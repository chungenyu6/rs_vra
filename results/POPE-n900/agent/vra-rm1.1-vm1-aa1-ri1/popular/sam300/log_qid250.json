But then the vision model provided an update saying there is a person with a handbag. So I need to correct my answer.\n\nThe user's latest query is just \"Is there a handbag in the image?\" again, but now with the updated info from the vision model. The revised answer already states there is a handbag. The system prompt says to use the FinalAnswer function directly. So I should just confirm with \"Yes\" since the updated analysis confirms it. No need for extra details here, just the straightforward answer as per the instruction.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
