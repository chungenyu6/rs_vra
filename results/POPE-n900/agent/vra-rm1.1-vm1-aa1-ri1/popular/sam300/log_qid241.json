The latest answer from the assistant confirms multiple people, including those numbers. Since the question is straightforward (\"Is there a person in the image?\"), the answer is clearly yes because there are pedestrians and cyclists present. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. The answer should be \"Yes\" based on the provided information.\n\nWait, the user's current input is just the system reminder, but the actual question was already answered in the history. The user might be expecting a confirmation. The last revision's answer already says \"Multiple people are present\" with references. So the final answer should just be \"Yes\" wrapped in the FinalAnswer function. No need for extra details since the question was a simple yes/no.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
