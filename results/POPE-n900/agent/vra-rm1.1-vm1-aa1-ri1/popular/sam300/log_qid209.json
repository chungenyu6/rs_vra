But then the user provided new visual information confirming that some riders do have handbags. So I need to correct my previous answer.\n\nNow, the revised answer should include the new info. The user's latest input is \"Yes, some of the riders have handbags with them while they are riding the elephants.\" So I have to confirm that handbags are present based on this update. The user wants a direct answer now, so I should just say \"Yes\" using the FinalAnswer function. No need for extra details since the question is straightforward. Let me make sure I'm following the instructions correctly. The final answer should be concise, just \"Yes\" as per the user's request.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
