Looking at the conversation history, the initial answer was \"Yes\" and after some back-and-forth, the revised answer still confirms there's a person on the sidewalk. The latest information from the vision model says the person is there but not wearing distinctive clothes. So the answer remains \"Yes\".\n\nI need to use the FinalAnswer function and keep it concise. The user emphasized a direct answer, so just \"Yes\" without extra details. Make sure to follow the instruction strictly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
