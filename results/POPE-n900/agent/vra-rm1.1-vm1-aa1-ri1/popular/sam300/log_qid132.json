But then the vision model corrected me, pointing out a bowl-shaped object where the man is throwing the frisbee into. So now I need to update my answer.\n\nThe user's latest query is just \"Yes\" in code, but the actual instruction is to use the FinalAnswer function. They probably want the final answer after considering the vision model's correction. The revised answer from earlier says the bowl is present based on the vision model's input. Since that's the most recent and accurate info, I should confirm with \"Yes\" through the FinalAnswer function. Make sure to reference the vision model's input as the source.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nYes, there is a bowl-shaped object in the image [1].\n</FinalAnswer>"
