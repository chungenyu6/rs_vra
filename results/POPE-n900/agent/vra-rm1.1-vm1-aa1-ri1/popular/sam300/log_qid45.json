Let me look at the information provided so far.\n\nInitially, the image description mentioned a spoon resting on the table near the boy's hand. Then, when the vision model was asked for more details, it specified the spoon is green and positioned to the left of the central cereal box. The user's current query is the same as before: \"Is there a spoon in the image?\" \n\nSince all previous responses confirm the spoon's presence, and there's no conflicting information, the answer is definitely yes. The FinalAnswer should be straightforward, using the function as instructed. I need to make sure to encapsulate it correctly without extra text.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer:Yes"
