So the answer is definitely yes. The references back up this with both the vision model and the initial description. I need to use the FinalAnswer function and make sure it's concise. Just confirm \"Yes\" since the question is straightforward. The details about two men and vehicles are supporting info but the core answer is yes.\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
