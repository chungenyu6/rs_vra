Let me check the history.\n\nIn the initial answer, I said yes, mentioning the man, woman, and others. The critique wanted it under 50 words with citations. Then the tool response added that the boat is on a river. The revised answer included citations [1] and [2], referencing the original image and the tool's river info. The final answer should be concise, using the references properly.\n\nWait, the user's latest query is just the question again, and the system reminder says to use FinalAnswer. The last revision's answer was: \"People are present: a man, woman, and additional passengers/crew on a boat [1][2]. The boat is on a river [2].\" But the question is only about people, so the river part might be extra. However, the references are needed. Since the answer must be under 50 words, maybe trim to focus on the people and cite both sources properly. The FinalAnswer should be a direct yes with citations. Let me structure it as:\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes [1][2].\n\nBut wait, the references need to be correctly attributed. The presence of people comes from the original image [1], and the boat's location from the tool [2], but the question is about people. So the answer can be \"Yes\" citing [1], but since the revised answer included both, maybe include both references to cover all sources. Alternatively, since the river info isn't needed for the people question, just [1] is enough. Hmm, but the system might require using the latest references. The user's last instruction says to use the latest revision, which included both references. Maybe better to include both to be thorough. So the final answer is \"Yes [1][2].\"\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes [1][2]."
