The user's question was \"Is there a person in the image?\" and they want a direct answer with just \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n\nLooking at the previous interactions, the initial answer was \"Yes\" supported by the image description mentioning a group of people. Then there was a follow-up about clothing, but that's extra info. The user now wants a straightforward answer. \n\nThe latest revision from ReviseAnswer still says \"People are present,\" which confirms the answer is \"Yes\". The system reminder says to use FinalAnswer and be direct. So I should just respond with \"Yes\" without any extra details.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
