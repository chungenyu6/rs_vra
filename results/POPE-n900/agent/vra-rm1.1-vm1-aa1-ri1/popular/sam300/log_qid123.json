Then after some back and forth, the vision model confirmed only one person is present. The latest query is asking for the man's posture or activity.\n\nLooking at the previous responses, the vision model mentioned the man is \"standing on a snow-covered slope\" and \"looking at the mountain range.\" So his posture is standing, and his activity is looking at the scenery, probably not moving at that moment. I need to phrase this clearly, using the citations from the earlier answers. The user wants the FinalAnswer function, so I should structure it properly with references. Let me check the exact wording again to make sure accuracy and citations are correct.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The man is standing on a snow-covered slope, holding his ski poles, and looking at the mountain range in the distance [1][2]. He appears stationary, likely pausing to observe the scenery.  \n\n**References**  \n[1] visual information here (first response)  \n[2] visual information here (second response)"
