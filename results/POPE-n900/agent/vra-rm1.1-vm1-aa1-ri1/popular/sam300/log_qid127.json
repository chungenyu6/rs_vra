The latest revision from the vision model confirmed two people: the thrower and an observer. The user's current query is just \"Is there a person in the image?\" again, probably checking confirmation.\n\nI need to answer directly with 'Yes' using the FinalAnswer function. The references show there are at least two people. The answer should be straightforward since the information is confirmed. No need for extra details here. Just a simple 'Yes' as the answer.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
