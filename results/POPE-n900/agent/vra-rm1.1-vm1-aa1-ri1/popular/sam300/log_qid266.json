The user's question was \"Is there a person in the image?\" and they want a direct answer of \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nLooking at the history, the initial analysis didn't mention any people. The vision model's response confirmed there are no human figures, clothing, or shadows. The revised answer also states no person is present. All sources agree there's no person in the image. So the answer should be \"No\".\n\nI need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Just make sure to keep it simple and only the answer.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: No"
