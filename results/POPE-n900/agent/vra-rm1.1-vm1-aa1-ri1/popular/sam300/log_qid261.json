But when the vision model was consulted, it pointed out cars and trucks on a bridge. So the correct answer is yes, there is a truck.\n\nI need to make sure the answer uses the FinalAnswer function as instructed. The previous revised answer already says \"Yes,\" so I should confirm that and include the references. The user wants the final answer to be straightforward. No need for extra details unless specified. Just the \"Yes\" with the citations.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
