But then the vision model's response came in, saying there are bowls in the market stalls. That means my initial answer was wrong. I need to correct it.\n\nIn the revised answer, I should acknowledge the presence of bowls based on the vision model's input. The user's current query is just \"Is there a bowl in the image?\" after the system reminder. The correct answer now is \"Yes\" because the vision model confirmed it. I have to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Also, make sure to reference the visual information properly. Let me put it all together concisely.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
