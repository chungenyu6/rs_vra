Let me look back at the conversation history.\n\nPreviously, I confirmed that there are multiple people and then the vision model specified exactly 10 people. The last revision included that number. The user's current query is the same as before, but now I need to use the FinalAnswer function with the updated info. \n\nThe answer should be a simple yes since there are 10 people. I have to make sure to cite the reference from the vision model's input. The answer needs to be concise, just yes, but according to the instructions, maybe include the number as well? Wait, the user's question is \"Is there a person in the image?\" which is a yes/no question. The direct answer is \"Yes\" but the previous answers included details. However, the user's latest instruction says to directly answer with 'Yes' or 'No' without extra thinking. But the system reminder says to use FinalAnswer based on the last revision which includes the 10 people. Hmm, maybe I should follow the initial instruction strictly here. The user's first message asked for a yes/no, and the current prompt says to answer directly with that. So even though there's more info, the correct response is \"Yes\" in the FinalAnswer function. Wait, but the user's last message was just the system reminder, and the actual question was already answered. Maybe I need to check again. The user's latest input is the system reminder, so the actual question was the initial one. Since the last revision has the count, but the user's question is just asking presence. So the answer is \"Yes\" but perhaps the system wants to include the number? Wait the user's instruction initially said to answer with Yes or No. The follow-up questions added details, but the current query is the same as the first one. So the correct answer is \"Yes\" in the FinalAnswer function.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nYes\n</FinalAnswer>"
