Let me check the latest information.\n\nIn the previous interaction, the vision model confirmed there are no table-like structures. The initial description also didn't mention any tables. The last answer combined both sources to say no. Since there's no new info, the answer remains the same. Need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Just confirm \"No\" clearly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
