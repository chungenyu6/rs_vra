Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nThe initial description mentioned people riding elephants, but didn't specify size differences. The follow-up answers focused on direction and saddles, not size. Since there's no explicit data on size ratios in the given visual info, I need to infer based on typical scenarios. Elephants are much larger than humans, so the answer should reflect that. But since the user requires a direct answer using the FinalAnswer function and based on the last revision, which didn't include size details, I might have to state that the visual information provided doesn't specify the size ratio. However, the user might expect a general answer. Wait, the last revision's references included [1] and [2], which might not have size info. To comply strictly, since the provided data doesn't mention size, the answer should note that the visual info doesn't specify. But maybe the initial image's context implies typical elephant-human size? Hmm, the user's instruction says to base it on the last revision. Since the last answer didn't include size, the correct response is to state that the visual information provided does not specify the elephants' sizes relative to the humans. Alternatively, if I can infer from common knowledge, but the user might want only data from the given info. So safest is to say the visual info doesn't mention it. But the user's last follow-up question is about size, so maybe I should use the FinalAnswer to respond based on the available data, even if it's not present. Wait, the user's reminder says to \"directly answer based on the last revision.\" The last revision's answer didn't have size info, so the answer would be that the data isn't provided. Alternatively, maybe I missed a reference? Let me check again. The last references were [1] and [2], which were the initial image description and the follow-up about direction/saddles. Neither mentions size. Therefore, the answer should state that the visual information does not specify the size ratio between the elephants and the humans. But the user might expect a standard answer. Hmm, but I have to follow the given data. Alright, proceed with that.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer> The visual information provided does not specify the elephants' sizes relative to the humans riding them.</FinalAnswer>"
