Then there was some back-and-forth about whether the bowls were filled or empty, but the user now wants a straightforward answer without any additional details.\n\nThe latest revision still confirms that bowls are present, even though their contents are unclear. So the answer should still be \"Yes\" because the presence of bowls was confirmed in the image description. The follow-up questions about contents or number are separate, but the original question is just about existence. \n\nI need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. So the answer is Yes.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
