The initial answer said yes, with a woman playing tennis and others around. Then, after a follow-up, the vision model specified two people near a potted plant. The revised answer included that, citing references. Now the user is asking again, and I need to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nWait, the user's latest input is just \"Yes, there are two people standing in front of a potted plant on the tennis court.\" followed by my previous thought process. The actual query now is the system prompt telling me to answer the user's question based on the last revision and use FinalAnswer. \n\nLooking back, the user's original question was \"Is there a person in the image?\" The latest information from the vision model confirms two people near a potted plant. So the answer is definitely yes. The references and previous answers all support that there are people present. I need to respond with \"FinalAnswer: Yes\" to confirm.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
