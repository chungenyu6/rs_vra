The first response described the scene but didn't mention any handbags. Then the user followed up asking about bags or purses among spectators, and the vision model confirmed there aren't any. Now the user is prompting again with the same question.\n\nI need to check the latest information. The last answer from the vision model specifically addressed bags or purses and said no. Since a handbag falls under that category, the answer should be \"No\". The user might be asking again to confirm, so I should use the FinalAnswer function to provide a clear response without extra details.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo\n</FinalAnswer>"
