The revised answer cites that there are 10 people interacting near the buses. The user now wants a direct answer using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nSince the question is whether there's a person in the image, and the information confirms 10 people are present, the answer is clearly yes. I need to make sure to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. No need for extra details since the citation already supports the answer. Just a straightforward \"Yes\" enclosed in the required format.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
