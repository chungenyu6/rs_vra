Let me check the history.\n\nInitially, the assistant said no, based on the first image description that mentioned a bench but not a table. But then the user (maybe the system?) provided a new description saying there are blue benches and a table by the water's edge. So the revised answer correctly updated to yes, citing the new information as reference [2].\n\nNow the user is asking again, and the instruction is to use the FinalAnswer function. Since the last revision confirmed the table exists, the answer should be \"Yes\" through the function. Need to make sure I don't second-guess; just follow the latest info provided in the conversation.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
