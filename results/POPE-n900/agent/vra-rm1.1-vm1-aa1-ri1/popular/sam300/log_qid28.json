But then the vision model checked again and found that the person is holding a handbag. So the correct answer should be yes now. I need to use the FinalAnswer function and make sure to reference the tool call [1] from the vision model's confirmation. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes, there is a handbag in the image. The person near the bakery display is holding one [1].</FinalAnswer>"
