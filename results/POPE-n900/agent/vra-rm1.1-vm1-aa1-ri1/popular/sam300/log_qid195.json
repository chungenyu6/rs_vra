The latest answer states that there are two horses, with details about their positions. The user now wants a final answer using the FinalAnswer function. \n\nLooking back, the initial answer was \"Yes\" with explanations. The revised answers included more details but the core answer is affirmative. The references and questions are part of the process, but the final answer should be straightforward. The user's last instruction says to directly answer with 'Yes' or 'No', so even though there's more detail, the direct answer is \"Yes\" because there are two horses. \n\nI need to make sure I follow the initial instruction where the user said to answer with just Yes or No. Even though the conversation had more details, the final answer should adhere to that. So the correct response here is \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
