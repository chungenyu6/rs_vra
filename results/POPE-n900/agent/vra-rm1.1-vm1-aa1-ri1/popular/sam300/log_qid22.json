Let me check the history.\n\nFirst, the initial answer said no, based on the description of food on a table. Then there was a follow-up question to the vision model, which confirmed no vehicles or unexpected objects, even in the background. The revised answer included those references. Now, the user is asking again, but the latest instruction says to use the FinalAnswer function and be concise.\n\nThe user wants a direct yes or no. Since all the information from the vision model says there's no car, the answer is definitely no. No need for extra details now. Just answer with FinalAnswer: \"No\" as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: No"
