Then, after a follow-up about the string, the vision model confirmed the string is extended. Now, the user's latest query is a system prompt to answer based on the last revision, which mentioned the kite's presence and the string as evidence. The references are [1] and [2], but since the material wasn't mentioned in previous responses, there's no info on that. The last question asked about the kite's material (translucent or rigid), but the vision model hasn't provided that detail yet. So I should use the FinalAnswer function to state that the material isn't specified in the provided information. Need to keep it concise and accurate.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The material of the kite is not specified in the provided visual information."
