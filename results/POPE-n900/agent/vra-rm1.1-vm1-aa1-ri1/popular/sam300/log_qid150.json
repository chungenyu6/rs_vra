The initial description mentioned a woman playing tennis with a racket, two balls, and the court setup but no handbag. Then the assistant checked with the vision_model, which confirmed no bags or accessories. The revised answer clearly states there's no handbag and references the vision_model's confirmation.\n\nNow, the user is prompting again with the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function. Since the last answer already addressed the question thoroughly with the necessary references, I should just present that as the final response without further edits. The answer is correct and concise, so no changes needed here.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer>No handbag is present in the image. The vision model confirms no bags or accessories are visible near the woman or the court [1].  \n\n**References**  \n[1] vision_model response: \"No handbags or bags visible near the woman or the tennis court's surroundings.\"</FinalAnswer>"
