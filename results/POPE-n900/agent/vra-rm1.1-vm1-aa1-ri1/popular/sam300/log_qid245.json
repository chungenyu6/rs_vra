The latest information from the vision model says there are 10 cars parked near a large building. So the answer is definitely yes. The user might just need a straightforward confirmation now.\n\nThe user's latest query doesn't add a new question, just the system prompt to answer based on the last revision. Since the last revision already confirms the presence of 10 cars, I should just restate that clearly. The FinalAnswer function needs to be used here. No need for extra details, just a concise \"Yes\" as the answer, since that's what the user originally asked. Even though there's more info, the core question is whether there's a car, which is clearly true with 10 present.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(\"Yes\")"
