Then, when I checked further using the vision model, it confirmed there are no other circular objects like a bowl. So putting it all together, the answer should clearly state there's no bowl, referencing both sources. Need to use the FinalAnswer format as instructed.\n\nWait, the user's last message just says \"Is there a bowl in the image?\" again, but the context shows we've already addressed this with references. The latest system reminder says to use the FinalAnswer function. So I should present the answer concisely, incorporating the references from the previous steps. Make sure it's direct and uses the specified format.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo, there is no bowl in the image. The scene includes a vase with flowers and birds on a wooden table [1], and no additional circular or dish-like objects are present [2].\n</FinalAnswer>"
