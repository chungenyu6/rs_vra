But then the vision model's response corrected that to only one bowl next to the boy.\n\nIn the revised answer, it's clarified there's 1 bowl on the table next to him. Now the user's latest query is just \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on the last revision. The last revision's answer clearly states there's 1 bowl, so the answer should be \"Yes\".\n\nI need to use the FinalAnswer function. The user wants a direct yes/no. The references and other details are in the previous answers, but the current question is straightforward. Just confirm the presence based on the latest info from the vision model. So the answer is yes.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
