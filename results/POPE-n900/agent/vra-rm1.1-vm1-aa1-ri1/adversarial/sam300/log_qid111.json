Now, the user is prompting me to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision. \n\nLooking at the last interaction, after the vision model stated there are 4 people, the revised answer correctly answered \"Yes\" with the citation. Since the user's final instruction is to directly answer using FinalAnswer, I need to confirm the presence of a person. Since there are 4, the answer is definitely yes. No new information contradicts that. So the final answer should be \"Yes\" encapsulated properly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
