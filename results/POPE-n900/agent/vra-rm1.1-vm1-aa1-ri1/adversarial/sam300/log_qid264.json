The vision model confirmed the frisbee's presence. Since the user wants a direct yes/no answer without extra details, I need to stick to that. The final answer should be \"No\" because a frisbee isn't a ball. Make sure to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
