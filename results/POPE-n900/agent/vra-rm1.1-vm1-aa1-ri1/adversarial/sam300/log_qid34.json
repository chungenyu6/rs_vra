But then the vision model checked and confirmed there are bowls in the stalls and near carrots. So I need to update the answer. The revised info says bowls are present. The final answer should be \"Yes\" using the FinalAnswer function. Make sure to keep it concise.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
