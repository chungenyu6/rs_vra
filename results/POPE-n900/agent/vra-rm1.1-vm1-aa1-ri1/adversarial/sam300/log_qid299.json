Then, after a critique, the assistant asked the vision model to verify the toilet's presence and position. The vision model confirmed it's clearly visible on the right.\n\nNow, the user is asking again, and the latest instruction says to use the FinalAnswer function. The last revision included references and asked another question about obstructions. But the user's current query is just \"Is there a toilet in the image?\" again. Since the vision model has already confirmed it's there and visible, the answer should be straightforward. I need to make sure to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed and keep it concise. The answer should be \"Yes\" based on the vision model's confirmation. No need for extra details now.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
