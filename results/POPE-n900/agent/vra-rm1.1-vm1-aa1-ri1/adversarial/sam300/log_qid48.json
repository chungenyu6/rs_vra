After revising, the answer correctly stated there's no oven, citing the vision model's input. The user then provided a token usage note, probably wanting to minimize tokens. Now, the final answer needs to be even shorter, using the FinalAnswer function and keeping under 50 tokens.\n\nLooking at the last revision, the answer is already concise: \"No oven is present [1]. The image shows a boy at a table with a bowl, spoon, and cell phone [1].\" But maybe the citations can be streamlined. Since the vision model's response is the primary source, just citing once should suffice. The user emphasized brevity, so removing redundant parts. The FinalAnswer should be: \"No oven is present. The image shows a boy at a table with a bowl, spoon, and cell phone.\" That's under 50 tokens and avoids citations if they're not needed now. The system reminder says to use FinalAnswer directly, so perhaps citations aren't required here. Just answer clearly and briefly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer  \nNo oven is present. The image shows a boy at a table with a bowl, spoon, and cell phone."
