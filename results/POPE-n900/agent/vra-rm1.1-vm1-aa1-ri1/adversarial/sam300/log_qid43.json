Then there was a follow-up question to the vision model asking if there are other people, and the response was no. The revised answer incorporated that, confirming only the boy is there.\n\nNow the user is prompting again with the system reminder to answer directly using the FinalAnswer function. The last revision clearly states there's a person (the boy) and no others. So the answer should be \"Yes\" based on the information from both the initial description and the follow-up confirmation. \n\nNeed to make sure to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. No need for extra details since the question is straightforward. Just confirm the presence of at least one person, which is established.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
