Let me check the latest information.\n\nThe original question was whether there's a person in the image. The initial analysis said no, and after a follow-up with the vision model, it was confirmed again with \"No\". The revised answer states no person is present, backed by references.

I'll structure it with the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
