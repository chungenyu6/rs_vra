Then the user wanted a revision, so I asked the vision model specifically about a handbag. The vision model confirmed there isn't one. The revised answer included that, citing the vision model. Now the user is prompting again with the \"FinalAnswer\" function.\n\nI need to make sure the final answer is concise and uses the FinalAnswer format. The last revision already states no handbag is present, citing the vision model. So the final answer should just be \"No\" wrapped in the function. Let me check the instructions again. The user wants a direct answer, so just \"No\" inside FinalAnswer. Got it.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
