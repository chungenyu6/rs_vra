Now, after the follow-up question about the person's orientation, the vision model's answer says the person is facing towards the snow-covered mountains while on skis. The user's current query is just \"Is there a person in the image?\" again.\n\nWait, the user might be testing if I remember the previous answers. Since the initial question was already answered as yes, but maybe they want confirmation again. The latest information from the vision model still includes the presence of the person. So the answer should still be yes. I need to make sure I use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. The final answer should be \"Yes\" because the person is indeed in the image according to all responses.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
