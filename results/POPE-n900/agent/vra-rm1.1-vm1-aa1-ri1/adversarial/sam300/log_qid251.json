The revised answer already says \"People are present...\" so the answer is definitely yes. I need to use the FinalAnswer function with a straightforward \"Yes\" since the references confirm people's presence. No need for extra details here, just the concise answer as instructed.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
