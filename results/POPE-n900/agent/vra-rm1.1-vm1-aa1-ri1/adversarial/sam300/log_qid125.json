The user's question was \"Is there a skis in the image?\" and they want a direct answer of \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n\nLooking at the history, the initial answer was \"Yes\" with some details. Then there was a follow-up where the vision model confirmed the skis are attached to the person's feet. The revised answer still says \"Yes\" in the first sentence. \n\nThe user's final instruction is to use the FinalAnswer function and answer directly. Since all the previous steps confirm skis are present, the answer should be \"Yes\".\n\nI need to make sure I don't add any extra text. Just \"Yes\" inside the function.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
