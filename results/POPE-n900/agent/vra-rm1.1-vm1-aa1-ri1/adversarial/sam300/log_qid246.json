My first answer was \"No\" because the original description mentioned cars, buses, and a bicycle but no trucks. Then, through the critique process, I asked a follow-up question about large cargo vehicles, and the vision model confirmed their presence. \n\nSo, I revised the answer to \"Yes,\" acknowledging the cargo vehicles as trucks. Now, the user is prompting again with an empty message, but the system reminder says to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision.\n\nThe last revision clearly states there is a truck (cargo vehicle). I need to confirm that and present the final answer without further questions. The references and next question are part of the previous steps, but the final answer should just be \"Yes\" as per the revision. I have to make sure to use the FinalAnswer function properly here.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
