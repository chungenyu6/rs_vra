Then, after a follow-up, the vision model specified the traffic lights are yellow. The revised answer included that detail with proper citations.\n\nNow, the user's latest input is an empty message with a reminder to answer directly using the FinalAnswer function. Since the last revision already addressed the question thoroughly, I need to confirm if there's a traffic light. The answer is yes, and the latest info adds the color. But the user's original question was just about presence, not the color. However, since the follow-up provided more details, should I include the color? The user's final instruction says to answer based on the last revision. The last revision's answer states traffic lights are present and yellow. The question was \"Is there a traffic light?\" so the answer is yes, and including the color adds more info but the core answer is \"Yes.\" But since the user wants a direct answer using FinalAnswer, probably just \"Yes\" suffices. Wait, but the last revision's answer included both presence and color. Maybe the user expects the final answer to incorporate all available info. Let me check the last revised answer again. The revised answer says \"Traffic lights are present [1], currently displaying yellow [2].\" So the presence is confirmed, and the color is an additional detail. The user's original question is only about presence, so the answer is yes. The FinalAnswer should be concise, so \"Yes\" is sufficient. The references are already in the previous steps. The system prompt says to directly answer with FinalAnswer, so just \"Yes\" in the function.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
