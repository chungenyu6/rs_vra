The references provided confirm their presence. The answer also mentions other items like a handbag and backpack, but the main question was about suitcases. \n\nThe vision model's response specified both suitcases, so the answer is definitely yes. I need to use the FinalAnswer function to respond with \"Yes\" as the direct answer.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
