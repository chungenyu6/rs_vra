Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nIn the initial description, the assistant mentioned two bottles but didn't specify the material. The follow-up answer from the vision model stated the bottles are green and empty but still no material. The revised answer also doesn't include material details. Since there's no information about the material in any of the provided responses, I can't confirm if they're glass or another material. I need to inform the user that the material isn't specified in the given data.\n\nWait, but the user's last question was about material. The instructions say to use the FinalAnswer function. Since the data doesn't mention it, I should state that it's not provided. Let me make sure I didn't miss any details. The vision model's responses only mentioned color and emptiness, not the material. So the answer should be that the material isn't specified.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nThe material of the bottles (e.g., glass or another type) is not specified in the provided information.\n</FinalAnswer>"
