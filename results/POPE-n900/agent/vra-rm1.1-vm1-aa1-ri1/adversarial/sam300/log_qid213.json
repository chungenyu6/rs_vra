The assistant's first answer confirmed this, citing references [1] and [2]. Then, when asked about the bottles, the vision model confirmed they're on the floor next to the toilet, adding reference [3]. \n\nThe revised answer included all these points, stating the toilet's presence, the bottles on the floor, and the public restroom context. The user's latest query is just \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on the last revision. The last revision's answer was \"Yes\" with supporting details. Since there's no new conflicting information, the answer remains \"Yes\". The system prompt says to use FinalAnswer, so I need to format it correctly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
