Let me check the previous interactions. \n\nIn the first answer, I said there's no oven, focusing on the table with desserts. The critique suggested keeping it under 50 words and citing sources. Then the follow-up question asked about kitchen appliances in the background, and I confirmed there are none. \n\nNow, the user's latest query is just \"Is there an oven in the image?\" again. The revised answer already states no oven is present, citing both visual inputs. The system prompt says to use the FinalAnswer function directly. \n\nSo, the answer should be \"No,\" based on the previous analysis and citations. Need to make sure it's concise and uses the function properly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
