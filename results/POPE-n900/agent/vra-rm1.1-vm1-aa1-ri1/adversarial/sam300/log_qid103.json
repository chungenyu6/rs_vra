From the previous conversation, the assistant first said no, and then after a critique, they added more details. The vision model confirmed that there are no large vehicles like trucks beyond the cars and bus. The last revision of the answer clearly states there's no truck, mentions the cars and bus, and references the vision model's input. So the final answer should be \"No\" using the FinalAnswer function. I need to make sure to follow the user's instruction to use the function and keep it concise.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
