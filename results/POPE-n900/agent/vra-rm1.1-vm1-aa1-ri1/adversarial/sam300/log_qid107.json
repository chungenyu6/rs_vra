Then, the vision model confirmed they're on grass. The revised answer already says there are two cars. The user's latest query is the same question again. Since the answer is yes, I need to use the FinalAnswer function. The previous steps have all confirmed the presence of the cars, so the final answer should be \"Yes\" with the details from the references. I should make sure to cite the sources properly as [1] and [2]. No new info contradicts this, so the answer is straightforward.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, there are two cars parked on the grass near the field\u2019s edges [1][2]."
