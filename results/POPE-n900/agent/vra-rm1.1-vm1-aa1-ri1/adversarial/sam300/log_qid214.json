The vision model explicitly stated there's no sink.\n\nSo the current answer needs to be a simple \"No\" using the FinalAnswer function. Since the latest information from the vision model confirms no sink, the answer is straightforward. Just need to make sure it's a direct \"No\" without extra details.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
