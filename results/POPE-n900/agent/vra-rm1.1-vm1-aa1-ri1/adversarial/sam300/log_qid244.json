Then, after checking again with a follow-up question to the vision model, it was confirmed there are no sports or beach-related items. The references are properly cited as [1] and [2]. The final answer needs to be concise using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nThe user's latest query is just \"FinalAnswer,\" so they want the definitive response. The answer should be \"No\" since both sources confirm no surfboard. I need to make sure it's formatted correctly with the function and sticks to the requirement of not adding extra text. Let me check the example again. The example shows FinalAnswer(\"Yes\") or FinalAnswer(\"No\"). So I should just put FinalAnswer(\"No\") here.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(\"No\")"
