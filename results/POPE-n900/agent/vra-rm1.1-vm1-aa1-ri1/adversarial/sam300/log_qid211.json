Let me check the information provided.\n\nLooking back at the initial image description, the first sentence mentions a \"white toilet.\" The follow-up answers didn't contradict that. The latest answer from the system also didn't mention any color change. So the toilet's color is white. I need to confirm using the references. The first reference [1] in the last answer points to the visual info where the toilet is described as white. Therefore, the answer should be white.\n\nI should use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. The answer is straightforward here. No need for extra details since the question is direct. Just state the color based on the given data.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer:The toilet's surface is white [1]."
