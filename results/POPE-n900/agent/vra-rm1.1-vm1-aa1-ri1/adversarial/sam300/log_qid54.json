The initial answer said no spoon was mentioned, but the user's follow-up with the vision model confirmed there are no utensils at all. The latest response from the vision model states clearly that no utensils like forks, knives, or spoons are present. So the answer should be a straightforward \"No\" based on that confirmation.\n\nThe user wants the final answer using the FinalAnswer function. I need to make sure to cite the references properly. The vision model's latest input (reference [2]) explicitly rules out utensils, so that's the key point here. No need for extra details since the user just wants a direct answer now. Just state \"No\" and reference the relevant citations.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer|No spoon is present [2]."
