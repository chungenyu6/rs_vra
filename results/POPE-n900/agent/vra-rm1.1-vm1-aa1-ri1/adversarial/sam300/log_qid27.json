Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nLooking back at the previous answers, the vision model mentioned the person is \"standing near the display of donuts\" and \"behind the display case.\" However, neither of the references [1] or [2] provided a specific numerical distance. The descriptions are qualitative (e.g., \"near,\" \"behind\") but lack exact measurements. Since the question requires an approximate distance and there's no numerical data in the references, I can't provide a precise answer. I should inform the user that the distance isn't specified in the available information.\n\nWait, the user wants the answer to use the FinalAnswer function. So I need to structure it properly. Also, ensure that I'm not making up data. The correct response here would be to state that the distance isn't quantified in the provided details. Alright, time to format the answer.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The distance between the person and the display case is not quantified in the provided visual information. The description only states they are \"near\" or \"behind\" the display."
