Then, after getting more info from the vision model that the ball is mid-air near the batter, the revised answer included that. Now the user's latest query is just \"Baseball,\" maybe asking for confirmation about the type of ball.\n\nLooking back, the context was a baseball game, and the vision model mentioned a baseball specifically. The revised answer already specified it's a baseball. The user might be confirming the type. Since all info points to a baseball, the answer is yes. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. So the final answer is \"Yes\" encapsulated properly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
