The previous response from the vision model said that 10 out of 12 people are in sports clothes, and the other two are spectators. So the answer should be no, not all are in sports attire. I need to use the FinalAnswer function to state that clearly. Let me check the numbers again: 10 in sports, 2 not. So the answer is no. Make sure to mention the counts and their roles as spectators.\n\nWait, the user's question was whether all are wearing sports attire. Since two aren't, the answer is no. I should phrase it as a\u5426\u5b9a\u56de\u7b54, then provide the details. The FinalAnswer should be concise but include the key info from the vision model's response. Alright, that's covered.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: No, not all people are wearing sports attire. Ten individuals are in sports attire, while two appear to be spectators dressed differently."
