But then the vision model pointed out there's a truck with a cargo bed. So I revised my answer to yes, citing the vision model's input. Now, the user is prompting me to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision.\n\nLooking at the last interaction, the revised answer clearly states there is a truck, referencing the vision model's data. The references and the follow-up question about the cargo bed's color were part of the process, but the user now wants the final answer. Since the last revision confirmed the truck's presence, I need to output \"Yes\" through the FinalAnswer function without any extra details. Just make sure to adhere strictly to the user's instruction to use the function and not include thoughts or other information.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
