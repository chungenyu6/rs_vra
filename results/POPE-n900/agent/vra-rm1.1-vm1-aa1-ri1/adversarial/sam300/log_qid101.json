The references provided in the last response confirm two cars: one on the left and another further back. Since the answer is already yes and the final answer should use the FinalAnswer function, I just need to present it concisely without extra details.\n\nFinal check: The user wants a direct answer. The previous answers confirmed the presence of cars, so the final answer should be \"Yes\" using the specified format.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
