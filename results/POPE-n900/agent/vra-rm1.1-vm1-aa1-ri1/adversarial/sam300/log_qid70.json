The revised answer already states that clearly. The user wants a direct answer using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nSo, I need to confirm the presence of the cell phones. The last update mentions two phones: one held by a man and another on the table. The answer should be a simple \"Yes\" since the question is just asking if there's a cell phone. Even though there are two, the answer is still yes. I don't need to elaborate further because the user just wants a direct response. \n\nI should make sure not to add extra details unless necessary. The FinalAnswer should be concise. So the answer is definitely yes.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
