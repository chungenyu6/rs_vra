The vision model confirmed there's an orange, small backpack on the skier. The revised answer already states that clearly. The user hasn't added new questions beyond that, just a system prompt to answer directly. So the final answer should be \"Yes\" since the backpack's presence is confirmed. Need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
