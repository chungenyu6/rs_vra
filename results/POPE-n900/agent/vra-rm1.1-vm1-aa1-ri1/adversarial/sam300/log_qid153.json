The revised answer correctly states there are 2 pedestrians and cites the reference. Since the question is simply whether a person is present, the answer is clearly yes. I need to confirm with the FinalAnswer function. Just make sure to use the exact parameters: \"yes\" and the reference.\n\nFinal answer should be: FinalAnswer(answer=\"Yes\", references=[\"[1]\"])\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(answer=\"Yes\", references=[\"[1]\"])"
