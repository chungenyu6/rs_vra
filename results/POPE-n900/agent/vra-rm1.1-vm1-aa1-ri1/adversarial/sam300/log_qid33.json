The vision model then confirmed that broccoli florets are clearly visible among the vegetables. The revised answer cited this confirmation. Now, the user's latest query is a reminder to use the FinalAnswer function directly.\n\nI need to ensure the final answer is concise and incorporates the key points from the vision model's confirmation. The last revision mentioned that broccoli is present with multiple bunches clearly visible, citing the vision model's response. The references are properly noted. Since the user wants the final answer through the specified function, I should present it without extra formatting beyond what's required. \n\nThe FinalAnswer should be a straightforward \"Yes\" as the question is a direct yes/no query. The previous detailed explanation is in the revised answer, but the user's current prompt specifies to answer with just \"Yes\" or \"No\" using the function. So the correct response here is \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
