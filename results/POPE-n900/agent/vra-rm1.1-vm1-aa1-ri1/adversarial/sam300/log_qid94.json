Then, when I checked again with the vision model specifically about vehicles, it confirmed there are none. So combining both pieces of info, the answer is definitely no. Need to present this clearly using the FinalAnswer function.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo, there is no car in the image. The scene includes a young girl flying a kite, other people on the beach, and two birds, but no vehicles are present.\n</FinalAnswer>"
