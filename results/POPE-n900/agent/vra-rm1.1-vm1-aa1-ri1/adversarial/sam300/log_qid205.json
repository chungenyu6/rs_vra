The follow-up determined it's an informal setting. The revised answer states eight people are there. The final references and questions are about details like saddles or landmarks. \n\nThe user's current query is the same as before. The last revision's answer already says \"Eight people are riding elephants...\" which directly answers \"Yes.\" But the user might want a straightforward \"Yes\" now. Since the question is repeated, the simplest answer is \"Yes\" based on prior responses.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
