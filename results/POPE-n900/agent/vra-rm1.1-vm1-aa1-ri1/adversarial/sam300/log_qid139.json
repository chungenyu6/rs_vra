Let me look at the history.\n\nInitially, the assistant said yes, there are two trucks, left and right. Then the user asked for a concise answer, so the revised answer mentioned both trucks, with the left one confirmed as parked by the vision model. The right truck's status wasn't specified. \n\nNow the user's latest input is just \"truck?\" with the system reminder to use FinalAnswer. The user might be asking again if there's a truck, but given the context, they might want a simple yes/no. The previous answers already confirmed the presence, but the final answer should be straightforward. Since the vision model confirmed at least one truck (left one parked), the answer is yes. \n\nI need to make sure the FinalAnswer is just \"Yes\" as per the user's initial instruction, even though the follow-up provided more details. The user's last query is the same as before, so the direct answer remains \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
