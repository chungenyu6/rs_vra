Then, after a follow-up, the assistant specified it's a white box truck. The user's current prompt includes the system's instruction to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision.\n\nSo the latest information confirms the truck is white and a box type. The revised answer should incorporate that detail. The user wants the final answer using the specified format. I need to make sure the answer is concise, includes the color and type, and references the source. The previous response had a reference [1], so I'll keep that structure. Let me check the example again to match the format. Alright, the final answer should state the presence of the white box truck, its location, and the other elements in the scene as before, with the reference.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>A white box truck is present, parked near the center of the street [1]. The scene includes buses, cars, and pedestrians in an urban intersection.</FinalAnswer>"
