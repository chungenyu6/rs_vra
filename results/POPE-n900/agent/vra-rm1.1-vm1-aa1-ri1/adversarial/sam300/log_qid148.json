Then there was a follow-up about gloves, and the vision model confirmed no gloves. The revised answer included citations. Now the user's latest input is just \"FinalAnswer\" with the system prompt to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision.\n\nSo I need to compile the final answer using the last revised version. The last revision's answer states there's no baseball glove, mentions the tennis racket, and references the absence of gloves. The references are properly cited. Since the user wants the final answer now, I should present it clearly without extra explanation. Just the answer in the specified format. Let me check again to ensure all points are covered concisely.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo, there is no baseball glove in the image. The scene features a tennis player holding a racket with no gloves visible on their hands [1][2].\n</FinalAnswer>"
