Then there was a follow-up about ski lifts and trees, which confirmed a resort setting. The revised answer combined all that into a concise response with references.\n\nNow, the user's latest query is just a space and the system reminder. The actual question might still be the original one, but they want the final answer formatted with the FinalAnswer function. Since the last revision already answers the original question thoroughly, I should present that as the final answer. Make sure to include the references as specified. Let me structure it properly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, four people are in the image: a skier in yellow pants and a white jacket leading downhill, another skier trailing behind, and two more in the background [1]. The scene includes ski lifts and trees, indicating a resort setting [2]."
