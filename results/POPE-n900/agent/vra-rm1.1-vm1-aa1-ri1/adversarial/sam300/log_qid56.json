But then the user provided new info through a tool call that there are actually cars and a truck in the background. So I need to correct my previous answer.\n\nThe user's latest input shows that the vision model detected vehicles in the background. My revised answer should now confirm the presence of cars, referencing the updated information. I need to make sure to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed and keep it concise. Let me check the references again to ensure accuracy. The answer should be straightforward now since the tool call clearly states the cars are there. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes, there are cars and a truck visible in the background behind the tennis court.</FinalAnswer>"
