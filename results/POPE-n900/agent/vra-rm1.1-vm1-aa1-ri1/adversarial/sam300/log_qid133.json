Then after feedback, the answer got more concise with references. Now the user's latest question is about the umbrellas' colors. The vision model's previous response mentioned the umbrellas but didn't specify colors. The current answer needs to check if the color was mentioned.\n\nLooking back, the first tool response described one woman in black clothing and another with a handbag, but no umbrella colors. The second tool response focused on the setting, not colors. Since the color isn't specified in the provided information, the answer should state that the color isn't indicated in the available details. The user might want to know if the umbrellas are black, matching one woman's clothes, but without explicit info, it's safer to say it's unspecified. Need to use the FinalAnswer function and keep it concise.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The color of the umbrellas is not specified in the available details."
