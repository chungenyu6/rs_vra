Then the vision model's follow-up confirmed no circular objects like frisbees and added a parking meter. Now, the user is prompting me to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision.\n\nLooking at the last interaction, the user's latest input is an empty message with a reminder to use the FinalAnswer. The previous answer already states there's no frisbee, citing both the initial description and the vision model's confirmation. Since there's no new information introduced, I should just present the final answer as \"No\" using the specified format. I need to make sure to use the FinalAnswer function properly without any extra text.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
