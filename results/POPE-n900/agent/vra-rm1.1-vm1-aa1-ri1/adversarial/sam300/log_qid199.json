Let me check the latest information.\n\nThe initial answer confirmed a woman is present, and the follow-up specified no others are visible. The references [1][2] back this up. Since the question is straightforward, the answer is yes, but the revised answer states there's only the woman. Wait, the user's question is simply \"Is there a person in the image?\" So the answer should be \"Yes\" because the woman is there. But the revised answer already confirms her presence. However, the user might just need a direct yes/no. Let me make sure.\n\nThe user's latest query is just the question again. The system reminder says to use FinalAnswer. The last revision says a woman is present. So the answer is \"Yes\". But the previous answer included more details. Since the user wants a direct yes/no, I should respond with FinalAnswer(\"Yes\") based on the information that the woman exists in the image. The follow-up confirmed no others, but the presence of one person is enough for \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(\"Yes\")"
