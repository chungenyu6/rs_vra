The user's question now is asking for the color of the trucks parked on the street. \n\nLooking back at the provided information, the initial description mentioned trucks but didn't specify colors. The follow-up from the vision model also only confirmed their location next to cars, not their color. \n\nSince there's no mention of color in any of the provided sources ([1] and [2]), I can't confirm the color. The answer should state that the color isn't specified in the available information. \n\nNeed to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Keep it concise and accurate based on the given data.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No information about the trucks' color is provided in the available description.</FinalAnswer>"
