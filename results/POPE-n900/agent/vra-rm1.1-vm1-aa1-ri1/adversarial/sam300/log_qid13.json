The user asked, \"Is there a person in the image?\" \n\nLooking at the revised answer, it says, \"A person is present: a man surfing the river rapids in a wetsuit [1]. Two additional surfboards are unoccupied and likely unattended [1]. Other people are on the shore.\"\n\nSo the answer clearly states that there is a person (the surfer) and mentions others on the shore. The references back up the details about the surfboards. The user's question was straightforward, just asking if there's a person. The answer confirms that with the main surfer and notes others are present too. \n\nI need to use the FinalAnswer function. Since the answer is yes, I should just respond with \"Yes\" as per the instructions. The previous steps were for the thinking process, but the final answer needs to be direct.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
