The user's question was \"Is there a tie in the image?\" and I need to answer based on the latest information.\n\nLooking back, the initial description mentioned some boys had ties. Then the vision model specified that 14 boys are wearing ties. The latest answer included that number, so the answer should definitely be yes. The user wants a direct \"Yes\" or \"No,\" so even though the original question used \"a tie\" (singular), the correct answer is yes because multiple ties exist in the image. The FinalAnswer function requires just the answer without extra details. So I'll go with \"Yes.\"\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(\"Yes\")"
