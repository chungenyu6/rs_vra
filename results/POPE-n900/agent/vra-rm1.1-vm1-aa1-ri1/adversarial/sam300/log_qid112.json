Let me check the conversation history.\n\nFirst, the initial answer was \"No\" because the image description mentioned people around a table with no cars. Then, I added a follow-up question to the vision model to check for cars in the background or windows. The vision model responded that there are no vehicles like cars anywhere. \n\nThe revised answer combined both pieces of info, citing references [1] and [2]. Now the user is prompting again with the FinalAnswer reminder. \n\nThe correct approach is to use the FinalAnswer function with the updated answer that includes both references. The final answer should be concise, confirming no car is present, using the references properly. Need to make sure the answer is accurate and adheres to the user's instruction of using the function call.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No, there is no car in the image. The scene depicts an indoor social gathering with no vehicles visible in the background or through windows [1][2].</FinalAnswer>"
