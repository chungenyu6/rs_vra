But then the vision model was asked to check again, and it confirmed there are round containers and a bowl near the apples and utensils. The revised answer included that, citing references. Now, the user is following up with another query, but the current prompt just says \"FinalAnswer\".\n\nWait, the latest user input is just a line break and a system reminder, so maybe the user hasn't asked a new question yet. But looking back, the last interaction ended with the assistant posing a question to the vision model: \"What color and size is the bowl relative to the apples?\" So perhaps the user's next step is to get that info. But the user's current input is the system reminder to answer with FinalAnswer. \n\nHmm, maybe the user is expecting the final answer to the original question, incorporating the new info. The original question was \"Is there a bowl in the image?\" The revised answer says yes, with references. Since the vision model confirmed it, the final answer should be \"Yes\" with the references. Need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's latest message is just the system reminder, but the actual question is still the original one. So the final answer should be \"Yes\" with the references from the revised answer. Make sure to format it correctly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, there is a bowl in the image. It is located on the countertop near the apples and utensils [1][2]."
