Then after some back and forth, the vision model confirmed the skis are attached to the person's feet. The revised answer included that detail with citations. Now the user is prompting again with an empty query, but the system reminder says to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision.\n\nLooking at the last revision, the answer states skis are present and attached, citing both sources. Since the user's latest input is just a prompt to finalize, I should just present the final answer without extra details. So the answer is \"Yes\" because the skis are clearly mentioned as present and attached. Need to make sure it's a direct yes as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
