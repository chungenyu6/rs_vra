From the previous conversation, the initial description mentioned a skateboarder, vehicles, and urban elements but no fridge. Then the assistant checked further by asking the vision model about large household appliances, and the answer was no. The user now wants a final answer using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nSo, combining all that info: the image doesn't have a refrigerator. The references are the initial scene details and the follow-up confirmation. Need to make sure the answer is concise and uses the required format. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer({  \n  \"answer\": \"No\",  \n  \"references\": [  \n    \"Urban street scene description [1]: skateboarder, vehicles (cars, trucks, motorcycles), traffic lights, and people\",  \n    \"Vision model's confirmation of no household appliances [2]\"  \n  ]  \n})"
