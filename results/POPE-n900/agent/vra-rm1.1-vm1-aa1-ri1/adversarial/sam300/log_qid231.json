The revised answer states two distinct benches with a citation. \n\nThe user now wants the final answer. Since the vision model clearly confirmed two benches, the answer is yes. I need to use the FinalAnswer function and keep it concise. \n\nI should just say \"Yes\" because the question is a simple yes/no. The previous details are in the references, but the direct answer is yes. No need for extra info here.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
