The user then critiqued the answer for being too verbose, so I followed up by asking the vision model for more specific details. The vision model responded that there are 4 distinct cars with specific positions. \n\nNow, the user's latest query is just a prompt reminder to use the FinalAnswer function. Since the last revision already answers the original question with precise details (4 cars, their positions), I should encapsulate that into the FinalAnswer. I need to make sure to include the key points: the count, positions, and reference the vision model's input properly. Also, keep it concise as per the user's preference. No new information is provided beyond what's already in the last revision, so the final answer should reflect that.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, there are **4 cars** in the image. They are parked on both sides of the street: one near the left, another in the middle, a third toward the right, and a fourth further back on the right [2]."
