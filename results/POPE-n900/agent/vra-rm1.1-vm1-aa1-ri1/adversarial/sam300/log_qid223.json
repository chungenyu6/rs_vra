Let me check the history.\n\nPreviously, the assistant mentioned a snowboarder near the center-left. The user then prompted a reflection, leading to a follow-up question to the vision model. The vision model confirmed the snowboard is visible on the ground next to the snowboarder. \n\nIn the last revision, the answer was updated with citations: [1] for the snowboarder's location and [2] for the snowboard's visibility. The references are clear. \n\nNow, the user is asking again, but the system says to use the FinalAnswer function. Since the latest answer already confirms the snowboard's presence with references, I should just present that as the final answer without further steps. No new info is provided, so the answer remains \"Yes\" with the given citations.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>  \nYes, a snowboard is present in the image. It is visible on the ground next to the snowboarder located near the center-left of the slope.  \n</FinalAnswer>"
