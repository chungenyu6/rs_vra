Then there was a revision that also confirmed no person is present, citing references from the vision model and the initial description.\n\nNow, the user is prompting again with the system message to directly answer using the FinalAnswer function. The last interaction shows that the vision model's answer was \"No,\" so the correct response should be a straightforward \"No\" using the specified function. I need to make sure I don't add anything else and just present the final answer as required.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
