The previous answers concluded no handbag was present, supported by the vision model's confirmation. The last response included references, but the user now wants the final answer through the specified function.\n\nI need to make sure the answer is straightforward. Since all evidence points to no handbag being there, the answer should be \"No\". I'll format it using the FinalAnswer as instructed. No need for extra details since the user just wants the direct answer via that function. Let me double-check the instructions: yes, they specified to use FinalAnswer and keep it concise. Alright, that's all.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo\n</FinalAnswer>"
