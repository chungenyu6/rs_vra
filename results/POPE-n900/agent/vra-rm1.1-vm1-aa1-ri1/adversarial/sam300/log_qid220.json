Then they followed up about picnic tables, and the vision model confirmed there aren't any. Now, the revised answer includes both references. The user's latest query is just \"Yes\" or \"No\" to the original question. Since the information clearly states no dining table, the answer is straightforward. I need to use the FinalAnswer function with a simple \"No\".\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
