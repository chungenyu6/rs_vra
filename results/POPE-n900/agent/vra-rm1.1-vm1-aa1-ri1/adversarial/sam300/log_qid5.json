But then the vision model pointed out that two out of three women are carrying handbags. So I need to correct my answer.\n\nIn the revised answer, I acknowledged the handbags and cited the vision model's input. Now the user is prompting again with the FinalAnswer function. They want the most up-to-date response. Since the vision model confirmed the presence of handbags, the correct answer is yes. I should make sure to use the FinalAnswer format and include the references properly. Let me check the previous steps to ensure consistency. The key is to state \"Yes\" and reference the vision model's input. Alright, that's all.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>  \n**References**:  \n[1] visual information here"
