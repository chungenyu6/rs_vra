Then the user provided more info through the vision model that there are actually orange fruits present behind the flowers and a shadow on the wall. So I need to correct my previous answer.\n\nIn the revised answer, I included both the orange flowers and the fruits, citing the references from the vision model. The user's latest query is just \"FinalAnswer\" with the system prompt to use the FinalAnswer function. Since the last revision already addressed the presence of oranges (the fruits), the final answer should confirm that yes, there are oranges in the image, based on the updated information from the vision model. I need to make sure to use the FinalAnswer format and keep it concise.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(\"Yes, there are orange fruits present in the image, visible behind the flowers and casting a shadow on the wall.\")"
