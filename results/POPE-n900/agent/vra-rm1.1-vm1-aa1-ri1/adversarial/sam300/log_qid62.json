Then after some back-and-forth and additional info from the vision model confirming it's a pickup truck, the revised answer still says no, emphasizing the pickup truck.\n\nThe latest step mentions using the FinalAnswer function and the system prompt says to directly answer based on the last revision. The last revision's answer is \"No car is present. A white pickup truck [3] is in the image...\" so the final answer should be \"No\" because the image has a truck, not a car. Need to make sure it's a direct yes or no as per the initial instructions. \n\nThe user might want a concise answer without extra details now. So just \"No\" in the FinalAnswer.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo\n</FinalAnswer>"
