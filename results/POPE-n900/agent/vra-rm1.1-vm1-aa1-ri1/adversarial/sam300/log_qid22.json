The initial answer said no, and after a follow-up, the vision model confirmed there are no vases or floral decorations. The revised answer already states that clearly. Since the user is asking again, I need to make sure the final answer is a simple \"No\" based on the provided information. No need for extra details now. Just confirm the absence of a vase as per the references.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo\n</FinalAnswer>"
