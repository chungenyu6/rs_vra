Then there was a revision incorporating new info from the vision model, which said the person is looking at the rider. Now, the user is prompting again with the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nWait, the user's latest input is just a line of code: <system>Directly answer the user's question based on the last revision. Respond with FinalAnswer function.</reminder>. Then the user's actual question might be missing here, but looking at the history, the original question was about whether there's a person in the image. The last revision confirmed two people. The assistant needs to use the FinalAnswer function now. The final answer should be \"Yes\" as the core answer, encapsulated properly. Let me check the last answer given. The revised answer says yes with two people. So the final answer should just be \"Yes\" using the required format. The user might be testing adherence to instructions here. The key is to respond with the FinalAnswer function with the concise answer.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
