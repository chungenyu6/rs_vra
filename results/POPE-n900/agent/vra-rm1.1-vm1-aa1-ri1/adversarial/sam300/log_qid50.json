The initial answer said no, but the user wanted it under 50 words with citations. Then after a follow-up with the vision model, the revised answer included references [1][2] confirming no person. The latest instruction says to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision.\n\nSo the final answer should be \"No\" and include the references. Need to format it correctly with the function. Let me make sure it's concise and meets all requirements. Yep, that's it.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No. The image shows a sandwich, coffee cup, cell phones, and an open book on a table, with no human presence visible [1][2].</FinalAnswer>"
