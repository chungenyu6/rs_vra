Then they asked for more details about their clothing and actions, which were provided. Now, the user is prompting again with the system reminder to answer directly using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nLooking at the history, the user's current query is just the system prompt, but the actual question being addressed is the original one: \"Is there a person in the image?\" Since the answer is clearly yes with two people, and all follow-up details confirm their presence, the final answer should be \"Yes\" with the necessary citations. The references are [1] and [2] from the tool calls. Need to format it correctly using the FinalAnswer function and include the references as specified.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nYes. Two individuals are visible: one actively skiing downhill [1], and another standing in winter gear, possibly observing surroundings [2]. Benches and snowy slopes contextualize the scene [1].  \n</FinalAnswer>  \n\n**References:**  \n[1] Initial scene analysis (Tool Call 1)  \n[2] Clothing/action details (Tool Call 2)"
