Let me check the conversation history.\n\nInitially, the description mentioned two large yellow buses and people but no trucks. So I answered \"No\". But then the vision model provided new info: there are cars and trucks near the buses. That means my first answer was wrong. The revised answer correctly says \"Yes\" with references to the vision model's input. The user now wants the final answer based on the last revision. The last revision's answer is \"Yes\" with references. So I need to confirm that the truck is present according to the updated information. The FinalAnswer should be \"Yes\" using the function specified.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes)"
