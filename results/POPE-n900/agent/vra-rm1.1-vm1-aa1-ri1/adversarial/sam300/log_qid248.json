The previous answer mentioned that the vision model confirmed no circular objects or discs. The references clearly state that there are no such items. The revised answer already says there's no frisbee. Since the user is following up, I need to make sure the final answer sticks to the provided data. The system prompt says to use the FinalAnswer function, so I should just confirm \"No\" based on the references provided. No new info suggests a frisbee is present, so the answer remains no.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer[No]"
