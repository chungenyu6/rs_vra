Let me look at the latest information.\n\nPreviously, I said no because the initial description mentioned backpacks but not handbags. Then the vision model provided an update [3] stating there are handbags: one being carried by a person and another near a passenger. So the correct answer now is yes, based on the vision model's input. The references should include [3] to back this up. Need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, there are handbags in the image. One is being carried by a person near the buses, and another is visible near a passenger [3]."
