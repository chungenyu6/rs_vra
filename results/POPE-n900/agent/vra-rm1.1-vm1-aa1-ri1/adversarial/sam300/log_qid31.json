The references confirm this with the vision model's response. Since the answer clearly confirms the presence of people, the final answer should be \"Yes\" with the details from the revision.\n\nNeed to use the FinalAnswer function and keep it concise. The key points are the count (10 people) and their activity (shopping). Make sure to cite the references properly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, there are ten people in the image [2], actively shopping for fresh produce at the farmers market through browsing and purchasing activities [2]."
