Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nThe initial image description mentioned bottles but didn't specify colors. The first answer confirmed the presence of bottles and cited the image description [1]. The follow-up from the vision model [2] said the bottles are filled with liquid but still no color info. \n\nSince the user's latest question is about the color, but none of the provided sources [1] or [2] mention colors, I can't answer that based on the given data. The instructions say to use the FinalAnswer function, but I need to ensure the answer is accurate. Since the color isn't mentioned, the correct response is that the information isn't available in the provided references. However, the user might expect an answer based on the existing data, but strictly following the given info, there's no color data. So I should state that the color isn't specified in the references.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The color of the bottles is not specified in the provided information."
