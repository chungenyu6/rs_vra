Then, when prompted, the vision model checked specifically for a yellow frisbee and confirmed there isn't one. The assistant then revised the answer using the ReviseAnswer function, citing the vision model's response.\n\nNow, the user is asking again, and the instruction is to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision. The revised answer states there's no frisbee, backed by the vision model. So I need to present that final answer properly. Make sure to format it correctly with the function and include the reference. Let me double-check everything to avoid mistakes. Yep, all steps confirm no frisbee, so the final answer is \"No frisbee is present. The vision model confirms no yellow frisbees or related objects are visible [2].\"\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo frisbee is present. The vision model confirms no yellow frisbees or related objects are visible [2].\n</FinalAnswer>"
