Then I generated a follow-up question for the vision model to check again, especially around people and the bench. Now, the vision model's response confirms there are no handbags. The user's latest input is just the vision model's answer. I need to use the FinalAnswer function to give a definitive \"No\" since all checks show no handbags are present. Make sure to format it correctly without any extra text.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer{No}"
