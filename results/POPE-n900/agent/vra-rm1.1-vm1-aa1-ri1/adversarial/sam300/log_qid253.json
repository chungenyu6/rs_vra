The user's question is whether there's a snowboard in the image. \n\nFirst, looking back at the provided information: the initial image description mentions a person skiing downhill with skis, and another skier. The vision model's response confirmed skis are visible and no snowboard is present. The references all point to skis being the equipment used. \n\nThe user's latest query seems to want a concise final answer. The previous answers have consistently stated there's no snowboard. The references [1], [2], and [3] all support that conclusion. I need to make sure the final answer uses the FinalAnswer function and sticks to the facts without adding extra info.\n\nSo the answer should be a straightforward \"No\" using the FinalAnswer syntax, citing the relevant references. I'll double-check that all sources are correctly noted and that the answer is under the word limit.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(No, there is no snowboard in the image. The skier uses skis [1][3], and no snowboard is visible [2][3].)"
