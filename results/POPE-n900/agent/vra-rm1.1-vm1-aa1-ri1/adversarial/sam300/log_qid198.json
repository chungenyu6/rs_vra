The previous answer from the vision model only mentioned that there's a truck and a car but didn't specify colors. Since the system prompt says to base the answer on the last revision, which is the current conversation, I need to check if the color was provided.\n\nLooking back, the user's latest input was the vision_model's confirmation of a car and truck but no color details. Since there's no information about the truck's color in the provided references, the correct response would be that the color isn't specified in the available descriptions. The answer should use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. I need to make sure not to assume any details beyond what's given.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The color of the truck is not specified in the provided descriptions."
