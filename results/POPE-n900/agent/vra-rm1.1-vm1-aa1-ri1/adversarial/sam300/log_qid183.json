The first response didn't mention a spoon, but after the user's follow-up, the vision model checked again and found spoons on the table, counters, and in bowls. Now the user is prompting me to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision.\n\nSo the latest info from the vision model says yes, there are spoons in those areas. I need to confirm that. The user wants a direct answer, so I should just say \"Yes\" using the FinalAnswer format. No need for extra details since the question is straightforward now.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
