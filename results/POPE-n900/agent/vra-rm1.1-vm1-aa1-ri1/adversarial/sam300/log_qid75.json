The initial answer said yes, and after some back and forth, the revised answer included more details from the vision model's response. Now, the user is prompting again with an empty message and a reminder to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nLooking at the history, the last revision already answers the question clearly with citations. The user probably wants the final, concise answer without extra explanations. So I should just output the FinalAnswer with the yes and the references as in the revised answer. Need to make sure it's under 50 words and strictly uses the function. Let me check the word count: \"Yes, the image contains broccoli [1], distinct from cauliflower by its elongated green florets and occupying about half the plate [2].\" That's under 50. Alright, that's the final answer.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nYes, the image contains broccoli [1], distinct from cauliflower by its elongated green florets and occupying about half the plate [2].\n</FinalAnswer>"
