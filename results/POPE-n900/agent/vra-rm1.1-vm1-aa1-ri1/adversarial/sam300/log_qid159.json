Let me check the history.\n\nInitially, the description mentioned multiple players and spectators. The vision model then specified there are 12 people: a batter, fielders, and spectators. The last answer included that count and roles. Now the user wants a final answer using the FinalAnswer function. \n\nSince the answer is straightforward\u2014yes, there are people\u2014the response should be concise. The references are already cited, so I just need to confirm \"Yes\" with the count. But the user's original question is a simple yes/no, so maybe just \"Yes\" suffices. Wait, the latest version has the count, but the user's question didn't ask for numbers. However, the instructions say to directly answer with 'Yes' or 'No'. \n\nHmm, the user's exact question was \"Is there a person in the image?\" Given the vision model's input that there are 12 people, the answer is definitely yes. So the final answer should be \"Yes\" using the FinalAnswer function. No need for extra details unless required. The user might just want a confirmation. I'll stick to \"Yes\".\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
