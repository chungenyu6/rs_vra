Then the user's follow-up had the vision model check specific areas like countertops, drawers, and near the cutting board, and it confirmed there are no knives there either.\n\nNow, the user is prompting me again with the FinalAnswer function. I need to make sure I'm using the latest information. Since the vision model specifically looked where knives are usually kept and didn't see any, the answer remains \"No\". I should just respond with the FinalAnswer function without any extra text. Let me double-check that I'm following the instructions correctly. The user wants a direct answer, so just \"No\" inside the function call.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
