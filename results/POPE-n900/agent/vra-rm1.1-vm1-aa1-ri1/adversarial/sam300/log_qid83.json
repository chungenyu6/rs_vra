The final answer should be a simple \"Yes\" as per the initial instruction, but the revised answer includes more details. Wait, the user's latest query is just a line break and the system prompt says to use the FinalAnswer function. The previous interaction shows that the answer is yes, so I should just output \"Yes\" using the specified format. Let me make sure I'm following the instructions correctly. The user might be testing if I adhere to the direct answer requirement. Since the final answer after revisions still confirms the cake's presence, the response should be straightforward.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
