Then, after using the vision tool, the follow-up confirmed there are no cars (response was 0). The revised answer cited the vision model's result. Now, the user is prompting again with an empty message, but the system reminder says to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision.\n\nLooking at the last revision, the answer clearly states no car is present, backed by the vision model. Since there's no new information and the previous steps confirm the absence of a car, the final answer should be \"No\" as a direct response. Need to make sure to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. No further analysis needed since all steps point to the same conclusion.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No</FinalAnswer>"
