The user's question is, \"Is there a person in the image?\" and they want a direct answer of \"Yes\" or \"No\". \n\nLooking at the previous interaction, the image description clearly mentions three people on the tennis court. The revised answer confirmed three people, with details about their attire. Even though there's info about their clothing, the core question is just about the presence of a person. Since there are three, the answer is definitely \"Yes\".\n\nI need to make sure not to add any extra info. Just the simple answer as instructed. The user wants it in the FinalAnswer format, so I'll structure it properly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
