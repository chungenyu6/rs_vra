The rest of the answer provides details but the key point is the confirmation. The references also support this with the visual data mentioning the dining table multiple times. \n\nEven though the user asked for a simple yes or no, the previous answers included more context. But the latest revision starts with \"Yes,\" so the final answer should just be \"Yes\" to adhere to the user's request for a direct response. The extra details are helpful but the user specifically asked for a yes/no. \n\nWait, the user's latest query is just \"Yes\" but the system reminder says to use the FinalAnswer function. So I need to make sure to format it correctly. The user might be testing if I can extract the direct answer from the revised response. Since the revised answer begins with \"Yes,\" that's the correct response here.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
