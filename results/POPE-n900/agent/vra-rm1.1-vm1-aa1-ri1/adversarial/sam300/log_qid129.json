I need to check the information provided so far.\n\nLooking back at the previous answers, the initial description mentioned the car is parked near the field but didn't specify the direction it's facing. The vision model's response only added the color as white. There's no mention of the car's orientation in any of the references provided (references [1] and [2]). \n\nSince the available information doesn't include details about the car's facing direction, I can't confirm that. The user might need to check the image again or ask for more details. But according to the instructions, I should use the FinalAnswer function. Since the answer isn't present in the provided references, I should state that the information isn't available based on current data.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The provided information does not specify the direction the car is facing relative to the field."
