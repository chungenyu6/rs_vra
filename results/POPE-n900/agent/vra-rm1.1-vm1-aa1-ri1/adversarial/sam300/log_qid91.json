The revised answer clearly states \"No birds are present in the image\" with references. Now, the user is prompting again with the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nI need to make sure the final answer is concise and uses the FinalAnswer function as instructed. The previous revised answer already says no birds are present, so the final answer should just be \"No\" since the user's question is a yes/no question. Wait, the user's original question was \"Is there a bird in the image?\" so the direct answer is \"No\". The previous detailed answer included references, but the system now says to directly answer using FinalAnswer. \n\nSo, the correct response here is to output \"No\" via the FinalAnswer function without extra details. The prior steps and references are already considered, but the final answer needs to be straightforward as per the user's instruction.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo\n</FinalAnswer>"
