Let me check the conversation history.\n\nThe initial answer said no bus, with references to the description and vision model. The last revision also states no bus, citing references. The latest vision model response confirmed no buses. The user's current prompt is just the system reminder, so I need to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nI should confirm the answer is still no, based on the vision model's input. No new info suggests a bus exists. So the answer remains \"No\" enclosed in FinalAnswer.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer<No>"
