The latest answer mentions the pizza clearly, including details about the crust, toppings, and table items. The references confirm the pizza's presence. So the answer is definitely \"Yes\".\n\nI need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. The previous steps built up the answer, but now it's time to just state \"Yes\" through the specified function. No extra details needed, just the confirmation.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
