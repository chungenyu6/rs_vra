Then, to be thorough, I asked the vision model if there are any other vehicles besides the car. The vision model confirmed that only the parked car is present. So, putting it all together, the answer is definitely no. There's no truck there.\n\nI need to make sure I'm using the latest information. The vision model's response is the most reliable here since it directly addressed the possibility of other vehicles. Since it said only the car is there, the answer remains no. No trucks detected.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer{No, there is no truck in the image. The only vehicle present is a parked car on the roadside.}"
