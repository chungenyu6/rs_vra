Let me check the history.\n\nFirst, the initial answer confirmed two surfboards: one being ridden and another held nearby. Then, after the vision model provided more details, the revised answer mentioned surfboards near the river's edge held by people. The references are properly cited. \n\nThe user's latest query is the same question again. Since the answer is already \"Yes\" and the updated details still support that (surfboards are present in both descriptions), I should just restate the final answer concisely using the FinalAnswer function. No new info contradicts this. So the answer remains \"Yes\" with references.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes, there are surfboards in the image. The main surfer rides one on the river, while others are held near the edge by people [1][2].</FinalAnswer>"
