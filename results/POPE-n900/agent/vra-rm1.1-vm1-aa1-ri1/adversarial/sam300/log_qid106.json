Then, after checking with a follow-up question to the vision model, it was confirmed again that there are no dining tables, chairs, or picnic setups. The revised answer included references to the stone wall and building mentioned in the vision model's response.\n\nNow, the user is prompting me to use the FinalAnswer function. The instructions say to directly answer with 'Yes' or 'No' without any extra text. The previous answers were both \"No,\" so the correct response here is \"No.\" I need to make sure I don't add anything else, just the final answer as specified.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer[No]"
