Initially, I checked the description and said there was no explicit mention, but then the vision model confirmed there's a baseball near the batter. So the correct answer now is \"Yes\".\n\nI need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. The references and citations were part of the previous steps, but the final answer should be straightforward. Just a simple \"Yes\" wrapped in the function. Let me make sure I'm following the user's formatting request correctly. Yep, just the FinalAnswer with the answer.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes</FinalAnswer>"
