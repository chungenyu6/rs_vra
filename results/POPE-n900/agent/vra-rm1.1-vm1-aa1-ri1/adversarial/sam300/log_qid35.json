But then the vision model provided an update saying there's a woman carrying a handbag near the vegetables. So the revised answer became \"Yes\" with a citation. \n\nNow the user is asking again, and the latest information from the vision model confirms the handbag's presence. The final answer should reflect the updated info. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. \n\nThe answer should be straightforward: \"Yes\" based on the vision model's input. No need for extra details since the user just wants a direct answer now. Make sure to use the correct syntax with the braces and quotes.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer:\"Yes\""
