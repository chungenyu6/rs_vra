Then, after the follow-up, the vision model specified that the forks are being held by people eating. The revised answer included that detail with citations.\n\nNow the user is prompting again with the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function. I need to make sure the answer is concise and final. Since the last revision confirmed the presence of forks and their usage, the answer remains \"Yes.\" I should present this using the specified function without extra text.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes"
