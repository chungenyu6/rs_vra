Then, after a follow-up question to the vision model, it confirmed there are no kitchen utensils like knives. The revised answer uses references [1] and [2] to back up the points.\n\nNow, the user is prompting again with the \"FinalAnswer\" function. I need to make sure the final response is concise and uses the required format. The previous revised answer already states \"No knife is present...\" so I should present that as the final answer, ensuring it's direct and in the specified function call. No new information has come up, so sticking with the revised answer makes sense. Just need to wrap it in the FinalAnswer JSON structure.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"FinalAnswer\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"answer\": \"No knife is present in the image.
