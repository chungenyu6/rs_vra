Then, when asked for more details, the vision model specified that the skis are attached to the person's feet. \n\nNow, the user is prompting for a final answer using the FinalAnswer function. The last revision from ReviseAnswer says to confirm the presence of skis, noting they're attached to the feet and the secondary figure's gear isn't relevant.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should clearly state that yes, there are skis, they're on the main person's feet, and the other person doesn't affect that. Need to make sure it's concise and uses the FinalAnswer format properly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nYes, the image includes skis. The main subject has them securely attached to their feet, while another person is visible in the background but their equipment is not specified.  \n</FinalAnswer>"
