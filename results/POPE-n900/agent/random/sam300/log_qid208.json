But after the user pointed out possible overlooked details, I checked again. The vision model confirmed there is a glove held by a rider. Now the user's latest query is just \"Okay,\" probably expecting a final answer. I should use the FinalAnswer function with the updated info. Need to make sure to include the reference to the vision model's confirmation. Keep it concise.\n\nFinal answer should state the glove is present, held by a rider, citing the vision model's response. Let me structure that properly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes, the image shows a baseball glove being held by a person riding one of the elephants.)"
