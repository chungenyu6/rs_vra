But then the vision model checked again and found that a rider is holding a handbag. The assistant used the ReviseAnswer action to update the answer. Now, the user is prompting for the final answer.\n\nSo I need to confirm that the handbag is present based on the revision. The final answer should be straightforward, citing the updated info from the vision model. Make sure to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>A handbag is present in the image. One of the riders is holding it while riding an elephant.</FinalAnswer>"
