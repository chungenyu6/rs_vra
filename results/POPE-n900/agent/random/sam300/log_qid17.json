Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nThe initial image description mentioned two surfboards but didn't specify details like logos. The vision model's responses only noted the colors (white and yellow) and the presence of the surfboards. There's no mention of logos or markings in any of the provided references or answers. Since the available data doesn't include that information, I should state that there's no indication of logos or markings based on the given details.\n\nNeed to use the FinalAnswer function and keep it concise. Make sure to reference the existing sources if possible, but since they don't cover logos, just say there's no information available.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The provided information does not mention any logos or markings on the surfboards."
