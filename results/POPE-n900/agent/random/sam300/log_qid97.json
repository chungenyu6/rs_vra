Let me check the conversation history.\n\nIn the previous exchange, the user first asked if there was a truck in the image. The answer confirmed two trucks, and then the user followed up about their colors. The vision model replied that the trucks are different colors. Now the user wants the specific colors. \n\nThe problem is, the provided information from the vision model only states that the trucks are different, not their exact colors. The user's last prompt tells me to use the FinalAnswer function, so I need to base the answer strictly on existing data. Since the colors weren't specified beyond being different, I can't provide more details. I should inform the user that the colors aren't available in the provided information. Need to make sure to use the FinalAnswer syntax as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer> The specific colors of the two trucks were not provided in the available information. The vision model only confirmed they are different in color. </FinalAnswer>"
