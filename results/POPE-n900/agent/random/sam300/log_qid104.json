Let me check the provided information again.\n\nFrom the initial description, there's a soccer field with cars, a bus, and a stone wall. The follow-up mentions no indoor appliances. Now, cars and buses are metallic and definitely larger than a soccer ball. The stone wall is made of stone, not metal. So the cars and the bus would qualify as metallic objects larger than a soccer ball. The answer should be yes, referencing the cars and bus mentioned in [1].\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, there are metallic objects larger than a soccer ball in the image, such as the cars (5 on the left, 1 on the right) and the bus parked behind the field [1]."
