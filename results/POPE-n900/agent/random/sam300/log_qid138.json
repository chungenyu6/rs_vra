Let me check the conversation history.\n\nFirst, I answered that there's no snowboard, citing the scene description. Then the user asked a follow-up about other sports equipment, and the vision model said none exist besides umbrellas. The revised answer included references to both points.\n\nNow, the user is repeating the original question. Since the latest information confirms no sports gear except umbrellas, the answer remains no. I should use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Need to make sure it's concise and based on the references provided. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: No, there is no snowboard in the image. The scene depicts two women walking with umbrellas, and no sports or recreational equipment is visible beyond the umbrellas. [1][2]"
