Looking back at the provided information, the initial descriptions mention traffic lights being present but don't specify their color. The follow-up from the vision model also only states their location at an intersection, not their current state or color. Since there's no explicit information about the colors of the lights, I can't confirm whether they're red, green, or yellow. The safest answer is to state that the color isn't specified in the given details. I should use the FinalAnswer function as instructed and keep it concise.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The color of the traffic lights at the intersection is not specified in the provided information."
