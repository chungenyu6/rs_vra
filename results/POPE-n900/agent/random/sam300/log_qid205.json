The first response confirmed multiple people riding elephants and mentioned a parked car and bench. Then, when the user provided more specific information (4 human figures, one not on an elephant), the assistant revised the answer to specify 4 people, three riding elephants and one on the sidewalk.\n\nNow, the user is prompting again with the FinalAnswer directive. The last revision already states there are 4 people, so the final answer should just restate that clearly. The key points are the total count (4) and their positions (3 on elephants, 1 on the sidewalk). Need to make sure it's concise and uses the FinalAnswer format as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nThere are **4 people** in the image. Three are riding elephants, and one stands on the sidewalk next to a road.\n</FinalAnswer>"
