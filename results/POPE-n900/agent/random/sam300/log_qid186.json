Then, when I followed up with the vision model again, it confirmed there are no animals or cat-like shapes. The revised answer already states that clearly. So the final answer should just be a straightforward \"No\" with the references. I need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Make sure to keep it concise and reference both sources properly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(No, there is no cat in the image. The scene features a kitchen with a table, vintage items, and a sign about modern kitchens, but no animals or cat-like shapes are present. [1][2])"
