Let me look back at the information provided.\n\nThe initial scene descriptions mentioned boats, including a large white boat with blue accents and smaller ones of varying colors. The follow-up from the vision model added details about the large boat's blue accents and the variety in sizes and colors of others. However, neither the original nor the revised answers mentioned flags, markings, or specific purposes like tourism, fishing, or signage. \n\nSince the provided data doesn't include flags or unique identifiers, the answer should state that there's no information about flags or markings. The user might be trying to determine the boats' uses (e.g., tourist vs. private), so acknowledging the lack of such details is necessary. Keep it concise and reference the available sources properly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo flags or unique markings on the boats are mentioned in the provided visual information [1][2]. The description highlights color variations (e.g., white with blue accents) and sizes but does not specify functional distinctions or symbols.  \n</FinalAnswer>"
