Let me check the previous responses to see if that information was provided.\n\nLooking back, the initial description mentioned \"One of the women is wearing a black jacket,\" so that's the color. The vision model's first answer [1] included that detail. The revised answer didn't repeat the color, but the original info is still valid. Since the user's new question is about the jacket's color, the answer is black. Need to use the FinalAnswer function and cite the correct reference.\n\nWait, the references in the last message were [1] and [2], where [1] is the first vision response which included the jacket detail. So the citation should be [1]. Make sure to format it correctly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(The jacket worn by one of the individuals is black [1].)"
