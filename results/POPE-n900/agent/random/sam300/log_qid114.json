Let me check the previous interactions.\n\nFirst, the initial answer said there's no racket, based on the description of people, wine glasses, and a phone. The critique suggested ensuring the answer explicitly states the description's completeness. Then, the vision model was asked about sports items, and it confirmed no rackets or balls. \n\nIn the revised answer, they cited the references and made it clear. Now, the user's latest query is just \"Okay,\" but the system prompt says to use the FinalAnswer function. \n\nThe user probably just wants a concise confirmation. Since all sources confirm no racket, the final answer should be straightforward. Need to make sure to use the function as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo, there is no tennis racket in the image. The scene shows a group of people socializing around a dining table with wine glasses and a cell phone, but no sports equipment is visible.\n</FinalAnswer>"
