Then, when prompted, the vision model confirmed there are no elephant-shaped objects or animals. The latest response from the vision model after the follow-up question also states there's no elephant, just a harbor scene.\n\nSo the user probably wants a concise, definitive answer now. The instructions say to use the FinalAnswer function and keep it under 50 words. Since all the checks confirm no elephant is present, the answer should be straightforward. Need to make sure to reference the vision model's confirmation properly. Let me structure it clearly without extra details, just the answer and the citation.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(No, there is no elephant in the image. The scene depicts a harbor with boats and people, and no animal forms are present [1].)"
