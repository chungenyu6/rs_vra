The initial description mentioned a dining table with sandwiches, coffee, bottles, and a phone, all indoors. When asked about windows or outdoor elements, the vision model confirmed there are none. \n\nSo putting it all together: the scene is strictly indoor with no outdoor features. Traffic lights are outdoor objects, so they can't be present here. The revised answer already addressed this with citations. Now, the user wants the final answer using the FinalAnswer function. I need to make sure it's concise and includes the references properly.\n\nFinal answer should state no traffic light exists, citing both sources. Keep it straightforward.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo, there is no traffic light in the image. The scene depicts an indoor dining table with sandwiches, coffee, and bottles, and no windows or outdoor elements are visible.  \n</FinalAnswer>"
