Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nIn the initial description, the skateboard is mentioned as black with white wheels and no notable graphics. The second tool response added that there are no visible graphics or accessories. However, there's no mention of scratches or wear on the deck. Since the vision model didn't report any signs of wear, I should state that there's no visible wear based on the provided data. Need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nThe skateboard's deck does not show visible scratches or signs of wear based on the available information.\n</FinalAnswer>"
