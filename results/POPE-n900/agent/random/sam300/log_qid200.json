Then the vision model updated that there are actually two sandwiches on the table. So the correct answer now is yes. I need to confirm the presence of the sandwiches using the FinalAnswer function. The user might be checking for accuracy, so clarity is key. Let me make sure to state it clearly.\n</think>\n\n**FinalAnswer**: Yes, there are two sandwiches on the table alongside the pizzas."
