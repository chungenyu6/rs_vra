Then they asked for the truck's color, and the vision model said it's red with no markings. The revised answer included that. Now the user's latest query is a system prompt telling me to answer their question using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nWait, the user's current input is just the system reminder. Looking back, the last user question was about the truck's orientation: \"Is the red truck's orientation facing towards the center of the street or away from it?\" \n\nBut in the provided references, there's no information about the truck's orientation. The vision model's responses only mentioned location (left edge), color (red), and lack of markings. The original description didn't specify the truck's direction. \n\nHmm, so I need to check if the vision model provided any details about the truck's orientation. The initial scene description mentions the truck is near the left edge but doesn't say which way it's facing. The follow-up answer about color also didn't address orientation. \n\nSince there's no data on the truck's orientation in the given references, I can't confirm that. The safest answer is to state that the orientation isn't specified in the provided information. \n\nTherefore, the final answer should note the lack of information on the truck's facing direction, relying only on the available references.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The orientation of the red truck is not specified in the provided visual information. Available data confirms its red color [2] and position near the left edge [1], but no details about its facing direction are included."
