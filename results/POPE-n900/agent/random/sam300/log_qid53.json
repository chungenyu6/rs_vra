Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nIn the previous interactions, the vision model described the cell phone as black and small but didn't mention the screen's state. The initial description also didn't specify if the screen was on. Since there's no visual data about the screen's illumination, I can't confirm. I should state that the information isn't available in the provided descriptions. Need to use the FinalAnswer function and keep it concise.\n</think>\n\n**FinalAnswer**: The provided visual information does not specify whether the cell phone\u2019s screen is illuminated or dark."
