I called the vision model which said the carrots are orange. Now the user is expecting the final answer.\n\nI need to use the FinalAnswer function here. The answer should be straightforward since the vision model already provided the color. Just state that the carrots are orange. Keep it concise as per the instructions. Make sure to format it correctly without any markdown. Let me check the example again to confirm the syntax. Yep, it's just the function call with the answer inside. Alright, ready to respond.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>The carrots in the image are orange.</FinalAnswer>"
