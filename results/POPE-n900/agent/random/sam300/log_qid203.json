Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nThe initial description mentioned chairs around the dining table but didn't specify the material. The vision model previously confirmed the chairs are black [2], but material wasn't addressed. Since there's no information about the material in the provided references, I can't confirm if they're wood or another material. I need to state that the material isn't specified in the given data. The user might need to ask the vision model again for that detail.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The material of the chairs is not specified in the provided information."
