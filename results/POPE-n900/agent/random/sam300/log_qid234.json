Then, to be thorough, I used the vision model again to confirm there were no large animals or unusual objects. Both checks agree there's no elephant. The user wants a direct answer now, so I'll just state clearly that there isn't one, using the FinalAnswer format.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo, there is no elephant in the image. The scene shows only a group of boys in school uniforms posing on benches outdoors, with no large animals or unusual objects present.\n</FinalAnswer>"
