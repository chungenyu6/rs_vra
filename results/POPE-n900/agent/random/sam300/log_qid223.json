Let me check the previous interactions to make sure I get this right.\n\nFirst, the initial answer mentioned three snowboards scattered around, but the critique pointed out that it should clarify their position. Then, the follow-up question asked where the snowboards were located. The vision model's response said the snowboard is near the skier. \n\nIn the last revision, the answer was updated to say a snowboard is near the skier, citing references [1] and [2]. Now the user is asking again, and the system prompt says to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision. \n\nLooking at the last message from the system, after the revision, the answer states there's a snowboard near the skier. The user's current query is the same as before, so the answer should be yes, referencing the updated info. I need to make sure to use the FinalAnswer format and keep it concise. \n\nSo the final answer is yes, using the latest information from the revision.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>  \nYes, a snowboard is present and positioned near the skier [2], as described in the revised analysis of the scene [1].  \n</FinalAnswer>"
