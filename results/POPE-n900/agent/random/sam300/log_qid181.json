Then, after asking the vision model, we found out the bowls are empty. The revised answer included citations and more details. Now the user is prompting me to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision.\n\nLooking at the last message, the revised answer states bowls are present, their locations, and that they're empty, with references. The system reminder says to answer directly using FinalAnswer. The user probably wants the concise, final answer without extra steps. So I should compile the key points from the revised answer into a clear, citation-free response. \n\nThe answer should be: \"Yes, there are bowls in the image. They are located near the table and oven and are empty.\" That's under 50 words, includes all necessary info, and removes citations as per the user's instruction to use the FinalAnswer function. Need to make sure it's formatted correctly with the function.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, there are bowls in the image. They are located near the table and oven and are empty."
