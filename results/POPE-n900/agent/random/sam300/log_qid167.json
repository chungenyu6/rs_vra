The FinalAnswer needs to be concise, under 50 words. Let me check the word count. \"Yes, there is a silver car parked on the roadside, with two additional cars visible in the background.\" That's 20 words. Perfect. Make sure to use the FinalAnswer function and include the references as specified.\n\nWait, the references were [1] and [2] in the last revision. Should I include them here? The user's reminder says to use the FinalAnswer function directly, so maybe just the answer without references? The initial instruction said to put references in the answer if needed. Hmm, but the example in the history included references in the revised answer. To stay consistent, I'll include them. Let me confirm the word count again. Adding references might push it over, but the user specified under 50. \"Yes, there is a silver car (confirmed in follow-up [2]) parked on the roadside, with two additional cars visible in the background [1].\" That's 31 words. Okay, that works.\n</think>\n\n**FinalAnswer(**  \nYes, there is a silver car (confirmed in follow-up [2]) parked on the roadside, with two additional cars visible in the background [1].  \n **)**"
