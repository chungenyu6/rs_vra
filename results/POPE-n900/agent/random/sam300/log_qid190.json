The revised answer then confirmed the presence of surfboards using that new information.\n\nNow, the user is prompting again with the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function. I need to make sure the final answer is concise and incorporates the latest data. The key points are: the initial denial, the vision model's correction about the boards, and the need to cite both sources properly. \n\nWait, the user's last input was just the system reminder, so the current step is to finalize the answer based on the latest information. The revised answer already says yes, citing reference [2]. The references section includes both the original description and the vision model's update. The final answer should just present the conclusion clearly, using the citations correctly. I need to ensure that the FinalAnswer includes the yes/no answer and properly references the sources. Since the vision model confirmed the boards, the answer should be yes, and the references are correctly noted. I should avoid any markdown and just state it plainly as per instructions.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(Yes, there are surfboards in the image. Two long boards are visible near people in the water [2].)"
