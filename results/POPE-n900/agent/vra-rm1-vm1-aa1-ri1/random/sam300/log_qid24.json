Then, when checked again with the vision model, it confirmed there are no kitchen appliances like an oven. The revised answer already states that clearly with citations. So the final answer should just reiterate that there's no oven present, using the references provided. Need to keep it concise and use the FinalAnswer format.\n\nHmm, the user might be checking for cooking tools or wondering where the food was prepared, but the image doesn't show any ovens. The answer should be straightforward. Just need to make sure to reference the vision model's confirmation properly. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(No oven is present in the image. The scene depicts a dining table with food items on a tray, and no kitchen appliances are visible in the background [1].)"
