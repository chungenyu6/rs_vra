Let me check the latest information.\n\nIn the previous messages, the assistant first said no bench was present, citing the initial descriptions. Then, after a follow-up to the vision model, the answer was updated with references [1] and [2], where [2] specifically mentions no benches or structures. The final answer needs to incorporate these sources and be concise.\n\nThe user wants a direct answer using the FinalAnswer function. I should make sure the answer is clear and cites the correct references. Let me structure it properly: state there's no bench, mention the ski slope and people, and cite both sources. Keep it under 50 words. Got it.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(No bench is visible in the image. The scene features a snow-covered ski slope with two skiers and one snowboarder, and no seating structures are present [1][2].)"
