Then, when the user asked specifically, I used the vision model to check again, and it confirmed there are no bags or backpacks. The revised answer clearly states that. \n\nSo the final answer should just be \"No, there is no backpack in the image.\" using the FinalAnswer function. Need to make sure it's concise and matches the required format.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>No, there is no backpack in the image.</FinalAnswer>"
