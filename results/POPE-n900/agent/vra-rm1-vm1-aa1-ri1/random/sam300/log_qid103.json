The revised answer still says no truck but mentions the bus and cars. The user now wants the final answer using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nSo I need to confirm that there's no truck, but there is a bus and cars. The key is to make sure the answer is concise and uses the required format. Let me check the references again. The vision model's response included a bus, which isn't a truck, so the answer remains negative for trucks but positive for the bus and cars. Got it.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nThere is no truck in the image. However, there are two cars and a bus parked near the soccer field. The scene focuses on a group of men playing soccer on a grassy field near a stone wall and building.\n</FinalAnswer>"
