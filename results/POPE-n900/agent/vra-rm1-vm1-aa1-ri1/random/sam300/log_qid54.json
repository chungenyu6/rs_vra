The vision model then confirmed there are no spoons. The revised answer uses references from the descriptions provided. So the final answer should clearly state there's no spoon, citing the sources. Need to make sure it's concise and uses the FinalAnswer function.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo spoon is present. The image confirms only a sandwich, coffee cup, and cell phone on the table [1][2].\n</FinalAnswer>"
