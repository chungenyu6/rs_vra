Then I asked the vision model directly, which confirmed there are no forks. The revised answer included that with a citation.\n\nNow, the user's latest input is just the word \"No\" from the vision model. The system prompt says to use the FinalAnswer function now. So I need to compile all the info. The final answer should be straightforward: there's no fork in the image, citing the vision model's confirmation. Make sure to keep it concise and use the required format.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nThe image does not contain a fork. The vision model confirms no forks are visible on the table or tray [3].\n</FinalAnswer>"
