Then, after a follow-up check with the vision model, it confirmed there are no kitchen appliances. The revised answer combined both sources to state clearly there's no oven. Now, the user is prompting to finalize the answer using the FinalAnswer function. I need to make sure the final response is concise and directly answers the question using the references provided. The key points are the absence of an oven and the sources confirming it. Let me structure it properly without any markdown, just plain text within the function.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer[There is no oven in the image. The scene features a vase with flowers [1], and no kitchen appliances are present [2].]"
