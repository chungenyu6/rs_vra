Then, after a follow-up, the vision model specified it's white with a tank. The assistant then revised the answer to include those details, citing sources [1][2]. Now, the user is prompting again with the system reminder to answer based on the last revision.\n\nSo the final answer should confirm the toilet's presence, mention it's white with a tank, and note its location by the right wall. Need to use the FinalAnswer function and keep it concise. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure I didn't miss any details. Yep, the revised answer already includes all necessary info from the sources. Alright, time to present that as the final response.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>Yes, a white toilet with a tank is present near the right wall [1][2].</FinalAnswer>"
