Then, following the process, I checked with the vision model again, which also confirmed there are none. The revised answer included both sources. Now, the user is prompting me to use the FinalAnswer function. \n\nI need to make sure the final answer is concise and includes the references properly. The previous step already combined both sources, so I'll restate it clearly. The key points are the absence of plants per the description and the vision model's confirmation. Let me format it correctly with the references as before.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(No potted plants are present in the image [1], confirmed by a direct visual check [2].)  \n\n**References**  \n[1] Initial scene description lists tableware, people, and an orange but no plants.  \n[2] Vision model explicitly states no potted plants are visible."
