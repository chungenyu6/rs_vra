Let me check the latest information.\n\nIn the previous interaction, the assistant provided a revised answer citing references [1] and [2]. The final answer clearly states there's no elephant, supported by the visual data. The user then sent a checkmark, probably indicating approval. Now, they're prompting again with the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nSo, the current query is likely the same. Since all previous steps confirm no elephant exists in the described image, I should just restate that using the required format. Make sure to keep it concise and reference the sources again if needed. Alright, time to format the final answer properly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nNo, there is no elephant in the image. The scene includes a pizza on a wooden table with no large animal-shaped objects.\n</FinalAnswer>"
