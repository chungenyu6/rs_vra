The initial answer said yes, there are several knives near the edge of the table, not directly next to the pizza. The revised answer incorporated that location detail. Now the user is prompting to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision.\n\nLooking at the last interaction, the user's final question was about the material of the knives. The assistant asked, \"Are the knives made of silver or another material?\" but hasn't received an answer yet. However, the user's current query is just \"</reminder>\", which might be a formatting error. \n\nThe user probably wants the final answer to the original question, which was about the presence of a knife. Since the last revision confirmed knives are present near the table's edge, the final answer should state that clearly. The material wasn't confirmed yet, so it's better to stick to the established info without speculating. \n\nTherefore, the FinalAnswer should confirm the presence and location of the knives as previously stated.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nYes, there are knives in the image. They are located near the edge of the table, away from the pizza [1][2].\n</FinalAnswer>"
