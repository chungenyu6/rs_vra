The initial answer said yes, based on the description mentioning \"a few individuals.\" Then, after a tool call, the vision model specified there are three people walking near a river with boats. The revised answer included that detail.\n\nNow the user's latest query is a follow-up: they want to know if the boats are motorized or non-motorized. I need to check the existing information. The original scene description mentions \"boats docked or floating nearby,\" but doesn't specify type. The vision model's response only says \"boats docked nearby\" without details about motors. Since there's no explicit information on whether they're motorized, I should state that the provided data doesn't specify. The answer should use the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer> The provided information does not specify whether the boats are motorized or non-motorized.</FinalAnswer>"
