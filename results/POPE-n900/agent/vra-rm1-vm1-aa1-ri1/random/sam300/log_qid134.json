The initial answer said no, and then after a follow-up, it was confirmed again that there are no additional objects like vases. Now the user is asking for a final answer. I need to use the FinalAnswer function. Let me check the references. The first response and the follow-up both state there's no vase. The references are [1] and [2]. The answer should be concise, just confirming no vase exists based on those sources. Make sure to format it correctly with the function and citations.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(\"There is no vase in the image. The scene includes two people, umbrellas, handbags, and a forest path, but no vase or other containers [1][2].\")  \n\n**References**  \n[1] Initial visual description  \n[2] Follow-up confirmation of objects present"
