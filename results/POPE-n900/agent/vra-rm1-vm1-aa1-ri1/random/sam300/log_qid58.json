The initial description mentioned a tennis scene with a player, racket, ball, and people, but no spoon. Then, when asked about utensils, the vision model confirmed there are none. The revised answer properly cites the sources and keeps it concise. So the final answer should just be a clear \"No\" with the references. Need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(\nNo, there is no spoon in the image. The scene depicts a tennis player, racket, ball, and spectators, with no utensils present.  \nReferences: [1] tennis court description, [2] utensil confirmation.\n)"
