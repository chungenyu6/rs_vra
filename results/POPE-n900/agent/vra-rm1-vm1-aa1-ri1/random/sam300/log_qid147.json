The initial answer mentioned a tennis ball but the critique pointed out it didn't confirm there were no others. The follow-up clarified that only a tennis ball is present. Now, the revised answer states there's a tennis ball and no others, citing the reference. The user's latest query is just \"FinalAnswer\" with the system prompt. So I need to use the FinalAnswer function with the revised answer. Make sure to include the reference properly.\n\nWait, the last revision was \"Yes, a tennis ball is present [1]. No other sports balls are visible in the image.\" And the reference is correctly cited. The user wants the final answer in the specified format. Just need to format it correctly with the function and ensure the references are included. Alright, that should be it.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer> Yes, a tennis ball is present [1]. No other sports balls are visible in the image.  \n**References**:  \n[1] vision_model response: \"No, only a single tennis ball is visible in the image.\" </FinalAnswer>"
