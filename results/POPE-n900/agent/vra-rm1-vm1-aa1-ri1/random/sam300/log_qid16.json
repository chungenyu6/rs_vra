But then the user provided feedback through the critique, pointing out that I should have used the vision model again. So I followed up by asking the vision model specifically about bottles near the bicycles or people. The vision model responded that there are indeed bottles on the ground and in some people's hands.\n\nNow, the user's latest query is just \"Okay,\" but the system prompt says to use the FinalAnswer function. The last revision already confirmed the presence of bottles based on the vision model's answer. The user might be acknowledging the correction. Since the revised answer is accurate and references the vision model's input, I should present that as the final answer. I need to make sure to include the references properly and keep it concise. Alright, time to format the final answer correctly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(bottles are present in the image, visible on the ground and held by some spectators watching the surfer.
