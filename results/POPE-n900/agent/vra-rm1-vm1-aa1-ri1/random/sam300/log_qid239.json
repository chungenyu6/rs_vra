Let me check the previous information provided.\n\nLooking back, the initial description mentioned the suitcases are placed near the cat, one to the left and another further back. The follow-up specified their colors and patterns but didn't mention size. Since the vision model hasn't provided any data on the suitcases' dimensions or relative sizes, I can't give an exact answer. I need to inform the user that the size isn't specified in the available details. \n\nI should make sure to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed and keep it concise. Also, mention that the information isn't available in the provided references.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>The sizes of the suitcases are not specified in the provided visual information. The description mentions their colors (black/brown) and a leopard print pattern but does not include measurements or relative size details.</FinalAnswer>"
