The previous answers established there are three people: two fully visible and one partially obscured. Now, the user is asking for a final answer using the FinalAnswer function, based on the last revision.\n\nLooking at the revised answer, it clearly states three people are present, with details about their visibility. The references are properly cited. The user wants the final response to be concise and use the FinalAnswer function. I need to make sure the answer is accurate and includes all necessary information without extra fluff. Let me check the word count and ensure it's under 50 words. Also, confirm that the references are correctly noted. Since the last revision already incorporated the vision model's input, I can present the answer as is, formatted properly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>  \nYes, three people are present. Two are fully visible: a man in a striped shirt with glasses and a woman holding a wine glass. The third is partially obscured [1].  \n</FinalAnswer>  \n\n**References:**  \n[1] Vision model response: \"2 out of 3 people are fully visible... partially obscured by another object or out of focus.\""
