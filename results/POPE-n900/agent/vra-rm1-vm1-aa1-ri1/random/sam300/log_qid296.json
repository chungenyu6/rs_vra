Then, after a follow-up question about spherical objects or toys, the vision model confirmed there are none. So putting it all together, the answer should clearly state there's no sports ball, using the citations provided.\n\nI need to make sure the answer is concise and uses the FinalAnswer function. The references are already in the last revision, so I can just restate it properly. Let me check the required format again. The user wants the answer to be direct, so something like \"No, there is no sports ball in the image [1][2].\" with the references. That should do it.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(No sports ball is present [1][2]. The bathroom contains only fixtures like sinks and mirrors, with no spherical objects detected.)  \n\n**References**:  \n[1] Initial image description.  \n[2] Follow-up confirmation from vision model."
