Then, the vision model was asked to check for glasses or containers and replied \"No.\" The revised answer incorporated that, clearly stating no wine glass is present and citing the sources. \n\nNow, the user is prompting again with the system reminder to use the FinalAnswer function. The last answer already has all necessary info: no wine glass, references to the description and vision model's confirmation. I just need to present this concisely in the required format without extra text. \n\nMake sure to use the FinalAnswer function exactly as instructed. No markdown, just the answer within the function. Let me structure it properly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: No wine glass is present. The image includes a couple on a boat holding a frisbee, cars, traffic lights, and a bench [1]. The vision model confirms no glasses, cups, or containers are visible [2]."
