Then, after following up on the kite's position, the revised answer included citations. Now the user's latest query is a bit unclear because they just provided a system prompt saying to use the FinalAnswer function.\n\nWait, the user's last message shows they included a system tag reminding to use the FinalAnswer function. The previous interaction ended with a question to the vision model about the kite's design elements. But in the current prompt, the user hasn't provided new information yet. Maybe they want the final answer based on the last revision?\n\nLooking back, the last question from the user was asking for the kite's design elements. But the current instruction is to use FinalAnswer. Since the last answer included references and was concise, maybe the user wants the final confirmation about the kite's presence, incorporating all previous details. The final answer should be yes, with the key points from the references, kept under 50 words. Let me structure that properly.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>  \nYes, the image includes a kite. The girl holds it, with part extending into the sky, featuring blue, red, and yellow colors.  \n</FinalAnswer>"
