Let me check the information provided so far.\n\nIn the previous exchange, the user mentioned that the sink has a faucet attached, but the material of the handle wasn't specified. The initial description only noted the sink's color (white) and material (marble), plus the presence of the faucet. There's no detail about the faucet's handle material in the given data. \n\nSince the available information doesn't mention the handle's material, I can't confirm it's chrome. I should inform the user that this detail isn't provided in the visual data. Need to use the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nThe material of the faucet's handle is not specified in the provided visual information.\n</FinalAnswer>"
