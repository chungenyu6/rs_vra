Then, when I followed up with the vision model, it confirmed there are no animals or horse-like figures. So combining both sources, the answer is clear.\n\nI need to make sure the final answer is concise and uses the FinalAnswer function. The revised answer already states there's no horse, citing the vision model's confirmation. I'll present that as the final response.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer:no horse is present in the image. The scene focuses on a person skiing down a snow-covered slope with no animals or horse-like figures detected."
