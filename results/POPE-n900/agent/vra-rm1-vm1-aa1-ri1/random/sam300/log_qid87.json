So I said no. But then the user, probably the vision model, came back and said there are handbags visible with people and near the buses.\n\nSo now I need to update the answer. The revised answer correctly includes that handbags are present, citing the vision model's input. The user's latest query is just a prompt to use the FinalAnswer function based on the last revision. \n\nThe final answer should confirm the presence of handbags as per the updated information. I need to make sure to use the FinalAnswer format and keep it concise. Let me check the references again to be sure. Yep, the vision model's response is the source. Alright, time to present the final answer.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, handbags are visible in the image. Some are carried by people walking around, and others are placed near the parked yellow buses [1].  \n\n**References**  \n[1] Visual confirmation from the scene analysis."
