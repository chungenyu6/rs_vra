Let me check the previous information provided.\n\nLooking back at the references:\n\n- [1] mentions people riding elephants with cowboy hats but doesn't specify saddles.\n- [3] and [4] describe the setting but not the elephants' physical state.\n- The initial answer notes riders but no details on saddles or health.\n\nSince there's no explicit mention of saddles or health indicators in any of the provided references, I should state that the visual data doesn't include that information. Need to make sure the answer is accurate and sticks to the given data without assuming details not provided.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nThe visual data does not explicitly mention saddles or health indicators for the elephants. The descriptions focus on their presence, the riders, and the setting (road-side with trees, possibly a tourist attraction). No details about physical conditions like saddles or health are provided in the references [1-4].  \n</FinalAnswer>"
