Then, the follow-up question checked for public facility markings, which weren't present. Now, I need to give the final answer using the FinalAnswer function.\n\nThe key points are: the toilet exists (white, seat up), the person and bottles are there, and since there's no public markings, the setting is just a bathroom without specifying public vs private. Keep it concise under 50 words. \n\nFinal answer should be straightforward, yes, and include those details. Let me check the word count. Yep, that works. Make sure to reference the sources correctly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer{\n  \"toilet_present\": true,\n  \"description\": \"White toilet with seat up, positioned on bathroom floor. A person in sandals and two bottles (one left, one right) are visible. No public facility markings on toilet or walls.\",\n  \"references\": [1, 2]\n}"
