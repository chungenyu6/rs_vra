The initial description mentioned a knife resting on the counter but didn't specify the handle material. The follow-up answer about orientation and position also didn't mention the material. The latest response from the system part doesn't include that detail either.\n\nHmm, since there's no information in the given descriptions about the handle's material, I can't confirm if it's wood or metal. The user might be expecting an answer based on typical kitchen knives, but without explicit details from the image description, I should stick to what's provided. I need to state that the material isn't specified in the available information. The user's next question after this would probably need to be about something else since the current data doesn't cover the handle's material. Let me make sure I'm not assuming anything beyond the given text. Yeah, the answer should clearly state that the material isn't mentioned.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: The material of the knife's handle (wood or metal) is not specified in the provided visual information."
