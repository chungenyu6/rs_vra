But then the user provided a tool response from the vision_model that clarified there is 1 person carrying a handbag and another with a bag. So I need to correct my previous answer.\n\nIn the revised answer, I should confirm the handbag's presence using the tool's information. The references are important here to cite the vision_model's input. The user wants a direct answer now, so I should use the FinalAnswer function with the updated info. Make sure to mention the handbag exists based on the tool's response. Keep it concise and accurate.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer[Yes, there is a handbag in the image. The vision_model confirms one individual is carrying a handbag while another holds a bag.]"
