Then, after the critique, I asked the vision model again specifically about umbrellas, and it confirmed there aren't any. The last answer cited that, so the final answer should just be \"No, there is no umbrella in the image.\" using the FinalAnswer format. Make sure to include the reference properly.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer(no_umbrella_in_image.md)  \nNo umbrella is present in the image [1].  \n\n**References**  \n[1] vision model response: \"No umbrellas held by people or placed near the backpacks and handbags in the image.\""
