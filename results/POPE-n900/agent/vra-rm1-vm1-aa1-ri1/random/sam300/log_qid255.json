The first answer mentioned multiple people, but then the user provided a correction through the tool response, stating only 1 individual is clearly visible, actively skiing.\n\nSo the user wants the final answer to reflect the corrected information. The revised answer should confirm the presence of that one skier, using the citation from the tool's response. The previous mention of other skiers was incorrect based on the latest data, so those details need to be omitted.\n\nI need to make sure the answer is concise, under 50 words, and uses the FinalAnswer function as instructed. Also, include the reference properly. The key points are: yes, there's a person, they're skiing, and the citation. No need to mention others since the latest info says only one is clearly visible. Alright, time to put it all together.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>  \nYes, there is a person in the image: a skier in yellow pants and a white jacket actively descending the slope [1].  \n</FinalAnswer>  \n\n**References**:  \n[1] 1 individual is clearly visible in the image. They are actively skiing down a snow-covered slope."
