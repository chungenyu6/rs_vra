The critique suggested that the answer assumed the description was exhaustive about animals. To improve, I should ask the vision model directly. \n\nThen, the vision model was asked if there are any animals besides humans, and it responded that only humans are visible. The revised answer incorporated that, citing the vision model's response. \n\nNow, the user is prompting again with the <system> tag, asking to directly answer using the FinalAnswer function. The last revision already states there's no sheep, backed by the vision model. So the final answer should just confirm that, using the function as instructed. Need to make sure it's concise and references the correct evidence.\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer>No, there is no sheep in the image. The vision model confirms that only humans are present.</FinalAnswer>"
