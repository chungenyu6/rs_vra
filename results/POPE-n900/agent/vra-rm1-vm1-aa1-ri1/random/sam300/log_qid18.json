But then the vision model pointed out a surfboard with wheels on the ground. That changes things. Wheels and ground contact mean it's a skateboard, not a surfboard. So the correct answer is yes, there's a skateboard. I need to use the FinalAnswer function and make sure to reference the visual info properly. Keep it concise.\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, a skateboard is present. The image shows a board with wheels contacting the ground [1].  \nReferences:  \n[1] visual information here\n</think>\n\nFinalAnswer: Yes, a skateboard is present.
