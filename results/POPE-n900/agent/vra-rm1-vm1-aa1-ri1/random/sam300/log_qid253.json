Let me check the conversation history.\n\nInitially, I said no because the description mentioned \"skiing,\" but the vision model later clarified that the person is using a snowboard. So I revised the answer to yes, referencing the vision model's input. Now the user is prompting for a final answer using the FinalAnswer function. \n\nI need to make sure the answer is accurate based on the latest information. Since the vision model confirmed the snowboard, the correct answer is yes. I'll format it with the FinalAnswer function as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>\nYes, the image includes a snowboard. The person is using a single snowboard to descend the slope [1].\n</FinalAnswer>"
