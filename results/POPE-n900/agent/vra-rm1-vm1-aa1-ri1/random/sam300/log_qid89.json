Then, when asked about their condition, the vision model clarified they're operational with closed doors and clear windows. \n\nNow, I need to use the revised answer from the tool response. The revised answer combines both the presence and condition, referencing the visual info points. The final answer should confirm the buses are there and note their operational state.\n\nI should make sure the answer is concise and uses the references properly. Let me check the guidelines again. The user wants a direct answer using the FinalAnswer function. Alright, putting it all together.\n</think>\n\n<FinalAnswer>  \nYes, two large yellow buses are present, parked with closed doors and clear windows, indicating they are operational.  \n</FinalAnswer>"
