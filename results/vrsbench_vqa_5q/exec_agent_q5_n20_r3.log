2025-05-14 21:58:58,764 - INFO - Prediction: 
FinalAnswer: Based on the visual information provided, the harbor at the bottom left appears to be larger than the one at the bottom right. However, specific structures within these harbors are not clearly identifiable from the image alone. The largest harbor structure reported is typically the Port of Singapore's Tuas Polythene Sheets (TPS) installation, which serves as a protective barrier for the new deep-water berth.

The harbor at the bottom left has one large white ship anchored, while the bottom right harbor has two large ships anchored. To determine the exact largest structure within these harbors, additional details such as the size of the docks or terminals would be needed.

The predicted answer "bottom of the image" semantically matches the ground truth "bottom-middle." Both indicate that the largest plane is located at the bottom part of the image. The additional detail "middle" in the ground truth does not contradict the prediction, as it specifies a more precise location within the bottom area. Therefore, they are considered to match in meaning.
