2025-05-13 18:47:25,609 - INFO - Prediction: 
The current arrangement of the airplanes does not naturally form rows, as they are mostly clustered together at the center with some additional planes positioned separately at the bottom left and right. Planes are typically arranged in clusters or by individual positions rather than in rows.

If you need an image where the planes are arranged in rows, it would be more typical to see such an arrangement during a demonstration or training session rather than at an airport. Would you like me to describe how you might visualize planes in rows for educational purposes?

FinalAnswer: The airplanes in the current image are clustered together with some additional planes positioned separately, and do not naturally form rows. For visualization purposes, imagine the central cluster of 10 airplanes arranged in two rows of five each, which is a hypothetical arrangement rather than their actual positioning.

2025-05-13 18:47:43,451 - INFO - Prediction: 
FinalAnswer: The planes in the image are represented symbolically and their actual sizes cannot be determined without a reference object. Since there is no specified scale or reference, we can only estimate the relative size of the airplanes visually. However, for a more accurate estimation, it would be helpful to know the approximate length of a known object in the image, such as the white vehicle at the bottom left. Without this information, we cannot provide an exact size for the planes.
