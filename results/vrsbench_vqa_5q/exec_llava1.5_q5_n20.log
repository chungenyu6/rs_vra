2025-05-14 21:38:37,375 - INFO - Prediction: 
The overall arrangement of the planes consists of several airplanes parked in a row on an airport runway. These planes are lined up, with some positioned closer to the foreground and others further back in the scene. This suggests that they might be waiting for takeoff or have recently landed at the airport.
